{"text": "3 \n \nEnterprise Risk Management \n \nPolicy Statement and Strategy 2024 \n \nRisk Management Policy Statement  \n \nLeicester City Council’s (LCC) approach to the management of enterprise risk \nRisk management involves identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, reporting, and communicating \nthe council’s threats and opportunities. By doing so effectively, LCC is in a stronger position to deliver \nits objectives. Risk is a feature of all business activity and is a n attribute of the more creative of its \nstrategic developments.  The Council  acknowledges that risk can never be eliminated  entire ly and \naccepts the need to take proportionate risks which should be identified and managed appropriately   in \norder to achieve its strategic objectives   . However, residual risks may still be high after further controls \nare identified and implemented. Such risks may relate to activities/projects where the organisation has \nstatutory responsibilities to deliver those services, and in such instances, it is important that  risks are \nbeing managed effectively and efficiently and the impact is minimised as far as is reasonably practicable \nshould the threat/event occur.   By assessing  potential problems and developing strategies to address \nthem, we are able to improve our chances of a successful, if not perfect delivery of the project/initiative \nassessed.  The Council recognise s that managing risk can also identify positive opportunities which, \nwith the appropriate level of control, may lead to service improvements. The measures which the Council \nadopts are principles of good management practice which seek to control and balance risk and \nopportunity. The risk strategy implemented at the Council supports this and ensures that high priority \nrisks are cost effectively managed and provide decision makers at all levels with the information required \nto make informed decisions.  \n \nThe key objectives of Risk Management at LCC are to: \n \n1. Proactively identify, manage and act on opportunities and threats to enable the Council to achieve \nits objectives and integrate risk management into the culture and day to day activities of the Council.   \n \n2. Prevent death, injury, damage, losses, and  reduce and minimise the cost of incidents and \naccidents.  \n \n3. Comply with governance requirements with risk management (identification of, and plans to \nmanage, risk) forming an integral part of the Council’s governance including decisions taken by the \nExecutive and  Corporate Management Team (CMT).  \n \n4. Make the Executive , CMT and Governance and Audit Committee aware of the potential  key \nstrategic and operational risks. \n \n5. Ensure the organisation’s risk profile and exposure is communicated top down , bottom up and \nacross the organisation and coordinate  targeted action plans designed to manage or reduce the \nrisk profile. \n  \n6. Embed, actively support and promote risk management . Raise awareness of the need for risk \nmanagement to those involved in developing the Council’s policies and delivering services  and \nensure it is understood that risk management is a cross service planning activity. \n \n7. Ensure that a systemic and consistent approach to risk management is adopted throughout the \norganisation and as part of divisional planning, performance management and models of operation. \n \n8. Supporting a culture of well-measured risk taking throughout the Council’s business and informing \noperational decisions by identifying risks and their likely impact. \n \n9. Ensure risks are considered, actioned and responsibility is assigned in the commissioning, \nprocurement and contract management of goods/services.", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 3}

{"text": "5 \n \n \nRisk Management Strategy  \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1. This Risk Management Strategy  provides a structured and coherent approach to identifying, \nassessing and managing risk. It builds in a process for regularly updating and reviewing  risk \nassessments based on new developments or actions taken  and  allows communication and \nreporting of risks that may adversely impact the achievement of the Council’s aims and objectives.  \n \n2. This strategy builds on , and replaces , the 2023 Risk Management Strategy. Through the \ncontinued development  and implementation of the strategy, the maturity of the Council’s risk \nmanagement will be reflected in a more enabled and proactive culture of embracing innovative \nopportunities and managing risks.   This strategy helps to embed a coherent risk management \nsystem throughout the organisation  and ensure s officers / staff understand their roles  and \nresponsibilities within the process  and if followed by staff enables a more consistent risk \nmanagement approach. \n \n \nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES \n \n3. The aims and objectives of Leicester City Council’s (LCC’s) Risk Management Strategy are:- \n \n To assist LCC in setting strategy, achieving objectives and making informed decisions ; \n \n To provide the Executive, Members and senior officers with regular risk management reports \nthat give a comprehensive picture of the Council’s risk profile and risk ranking exposure; \n \n To provide and assist the Council and its partners to adopt a “fit for purpose” methodology \ntowards identification, evaluation , control and communication of risks and to help ensure \nthose risks are reduced to an acceptable level – the ‘risk appetite’; \n  \n To ensure that transparent and robust systems are in place to track and report upon existing \nand emerging risks which potentially could have a detrimental impact on the Council or \ninfluence decision making and affect the achievement of objectives; \n \n To help further integrate risk management into the culture and  day to day working of the \nCouncil and ensure a cross divisional/operational approach is applied; \n \n To provide reliable information on which to base the annual strategic and operationa l risk \nand governance assurance statements; \n \n To consider the limitations of available information in the process of identifying and assessing \nrisk;   \n \n To encourage well measured risk taking where it leads to improving performance and \nsustainable improvements in service delivery; \n \n To ensure a consistent approach in the identification, assessment and management of risk \n(‘the risk management cycle) throughout the organisation; and \n \n To acknowledge that even with good risk management and our best endeavours, things can \ngo wrong and that we learn from this to prevent it happening again. Risk Management is \ncontinually improved though learning and experience. \n \n4. Given the diversity of services  offered by the Council, there are a  wide range of potential risks  \nthat could arise .  Therefore, it is essential that responsibility for identifying and taking action to \naddress those risks is assigned and clear. Commitment and involvement of staff at every level is \nessential to effectively carry out enterprise risk management. Although different staff/managers  \nwill have specific duties  to assist  in this process , it is important that they are aware  of and", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 5}
{"text": "6 \n \nunderstand their role. Staff involvement may consider views and comments from other divisional \nareas/teams who may have had experience of managing similar projects.   \n \n \nASSURANCE AND REPORTING STRUCTURE OF RISKS AT LCC \n \n5. As part of the risk management and assurance process, our aim is  to create a ‘no surprises’ \napproach where the commitment and appetite around risks management is set from the top down.  \n \n6. All staff and associated stakeholders have responsibility for managing risk, some more than \nothers. Please see Appendix 1 for full roles and responsibilities. \n \n                        \n \n \nWithin this structure, each party has the following key roles: \n \n The Governance and Audit Committee (G&AC) is responsible for noting the effectiveness \nof the Council’s risk management arrangements, challenging risk information and escalating \nissues to CMT and Executive via the Manager, Risk Management. \n \n City Mayor and Executive has a leadership and oversight role particularly in challenging \nCMT and senior managers in relation to the risks identified, mitigating actions and holding \nthem to account to implement effective risk management. The City Mayor and Executive are \nalso responsible for approving  risk policies an d strategy and  receiving regular risk \nmanagement reports to review; \n \n The Corporate Management Team  (CMT) has the risk oversight role  and ultimate \nmanagement accountability. CMT must ensure the risk related control environment  is \neffective; is responsible for approving and reviewing risk policies and strategies ; setting the \nlevel of risk the Council is prepared to accept – it’s ‘risk appetite’; receiving  4-monthly  risk  \nupdate reports to review and for approving as well as agreeing and promoting the training \nprogramme; \n \n Risk, Emergency and Business Resilience  (REBR) develops and coordinate s \nimplementation of the Risk Management Strategy and provides a facilitators role, supporting \nand guiding service areas  on how to complete operational risk assessments, whom they \nGov & \nAudit\nCommi\nttee\nCity Mayor / \nExecutive\nCorporate \nManagement Team \nRisk, Emergency & Business \nResilience\nDivisions, Departments and services\nManagement / Corporate functions and third \nparties / Internal Audit", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 6}
{"text": "7 \n \nshould refer to and deliver corporate risk management  and business continuity  training.  \nREBR also coordinate, populate and maintain the Council’s strategic and operational risk \nregisters, producing 4-monthly risk reports comprising of these risk registers to submit to \nCMT, City Mayor and Executive (SRR only) and the G&AC (bi-annually); \n \n Departments and services  are the ‘risk-takers’ and are responsible for identifying, \nassessing, measuring, identifying risk actionee, monitoring, communicating risk as  well as \nreporting on significant risks associated with their functions or activities and for managing \nrisks within their departments; \n \n As part of the Council’s combined model, management, third parties  (e.g insurers) and \nInternal Audit give assurance on the management of risks and the operation/performance \nof controls. \n \nSee Appendix 1 for further Roles and Responsibilities.    \n \n \nRISK DEFINITION AND APPETITE \n \n7. At LCC, we adopt the definition of risk taken from the International Risk Management Standard \n‘ISO31000 – Risk Management Principles and Guidelines standard and BS65000 – Guidance on \nOrganisational Resilience’: \n \n“Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives ” and an effect could be a positive or negative \ndeviation from what is expected. ISO 31000 recognises that we operate in an uncertain world. \n \n8. By identifying potential problems with an in-depth risk assessment, the Council can implement \ncontrols and treatments that maximise the chance of gain while minimising the chance of loss. It \nis assumed by many staff , during risk discussions, that all risks must be eliminated. This is not \nthe case. Risk is a part of everyday life and taking risks and acting on opportunities may be a \nroute to success, if managed proper ly, where the risk appetite is crucial to this process .  Risk \nAppetite is defined as ‘the amount and type of risk that the organisation is willing to pursue, \nretain or take (ISO73 – ISO2002)). Appendix 2 demonstrates the Council’s risk appetite. The \nCouncil is prepared to tolerate r isks that fall below the risk appetite line (the prominent \nblack line).  For risks that are scored above the line, the relevant Council officers should consider \ntheir occurrence (repetitiveness) and impact, and design controls for implementation to minimise \nthe chance of the  risk materialising. This should be monitored periodically. An example of this \nwould be total loss of a building by fire. This is a typical ’high impact’ but ‘low likelihood’ risk that \ncannot realistically be managed day to day, beyond normal management responsibilities, but if it \noccurs, would be dealt with by the invocation of a n effective  Incident Response Plan  and \nappropriate insurance cover which are both significant mitigants for that risk. \n \n9. Risk appetite needs to be considered at all levels of the organisation – from strategic decision-\nmakers to operational deliverers. The Council’s risk appetite is the amount of risk that it is \nprepared to take in order to achieve its objectives. Defining the Council’s risk appetite provides \nthe strategic guidance necessary for decision -making and is determined by individual \ncircumstances. In general terms, the Council’s approach to providing services is to be innovative \nand to seek continuous improvement within a fra mework of robust corporate governance.", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 7}

This \nframework includes a risk management process that identifies and assesses risks appertaining \nto decisions being considered or proposed. \n \n10. As such, risk appetite should be considered for every proposal and risk rather than an over -\narching concept for the entire Council. There will be areas where a higher level of risk will be \ntaken in supporting innovation in service delivery.  Certain areas will maintain a lower than \ncautious appetite - for example, in matters of compliance with law and public confidence in the \nCouncil or safeguarding adults and children. Risk appetite can therefore be varied for specific \nrisks, provided this is approved by appropriate officers and/or members. However, in all \ncircumstances:  \n \n The Council should manage its financial affairs such that no action will be taken which \nwould jeopardise its ability to continue as a going concern; and", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 7}
{"text": "8 \n \n The Council  is to secure the legal integrity of its actions always.  \n \nDespite this, at times the Council may be forced to take risks beyond its appetite to comply with \ncentral government directives o r to satisfy public expectations of improved services.  The \nchallenge process will determine the decisions made  - whether to proceed with such proposals \nand after careful assessment of the identified risks , and an analysis of the risks compared to the \nbenefits – i.e. cost benefit analysis. A cost benefit analysis also helps decide the appropriate level \nof commitment to risk management resources . It is important to keep in mind that not all cost \nbenefit is confined to financial measurement and the cost of no t taking action should also be \nconsidered, for example, the reputational damage from not progressing on an \ninitiative/project/service delivery proposal. \n \n11. LCC’s approach to risk is to be risk aware rather than risk averse, to manage and mitigate the \nidentified risk.  As set out in its Risk Management Policy Statement, it is acknowledged that risk \nis a feature of all business activity and is a particular attribute of the more creative of its strateg ic \ndevelopments. Directors and m embers are no t opposed to risk. They are committed to taking \nrisks with full awareness of the potential implications and in the knowledge that a robust plan is \nto be implemented to manage/mitigate them. The Council’s risk management process allows this \n‘positive risk taking’ to be evidenced. \n \n12. ‘Positive risk-taking’ is a process of weighing up the potential benefits and impacts of exercising \na choice of action over another course of action. This entails identifying the potential risks and \ndeveloping plans and controls that reflect the positive potentials and stated priorities o f the \nCouncil. It then involves using available resources , capabilities and support to achieve desired \noutcomes, and to minimise any potential ‘harmful’ impacts . It is certainly not negligent \nignorance of potential risks but, usually, a carefully thought-out strategy for managing a specific \nrisk or set of circumstances. \n \n13. The risk management process ensures that key strategic and operational risks are  controlled, \nminimising the likelihood of an occurrence and its impact should the risk occur and also allows to \nconsider further treatment options (see paragraph 14) and risk communications to take place . It \nis recognised that there are costs involved in being too risk-averse and avoiding risk, both in terms \nof bureaucracy and opportunity costs. \n \n14. The Council s eeks to identify, assess and respond to all strategic risks that may affect the \nachievement of key business objectives and plan outcomes.  Once a risk has been identified and \nrated, the Council will adopt a risk response plan based on the nature of the risk.  The Council’s \nrisk responses include treat, tolerate, terminate or transfer – refer to paragraph 26 for the detail.  \nIntegrating risk transfer strategies requires decisions at the highest levels as the risk appetite will \ndetermine the extent to which it is prepared to retain the risk, as opposed to sharing risk by \noutsourcing or insurance.  ISO31000 states the selection of risk treatment options involves \nbalancing the potential benefits of introducing further risk treatment (controls) against the \nassociated costs, effort or disadvantages.  The treatment plan should identify the timescale and \nresponsibilities for implementing the selected risk treatments. \n \n15.", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 8}

Having an effective enterprise risk management framework  does not mean that mistakes and \nlosses will not occur. Effec tive risk management means that  risks are highlighted, allowing \nappropriate action to be taken to minimise the risk of potential loss. The principle is simple, but \nthis relies upon several individuals acting in unity, applying the same methodology to reach a \nsound conclusion  and understand that risk management is a cross service planning activity . \nHowever, it is recognised that risk management and the analysis is based on judgement and is \nnot infallible or an exact science, and for a more accurate analysis, the appropriate people should \nbe involved  who should consider and understand ALL the available information at the time \nrelevant to that activity  but be aware there may be limitations on that information . Incidents may \nstill happen, but the Council will be in a better posit ion to recover f rom these incidents with  \neffective risk controls/business continuity  management process es in place. LCC is a “learning \norganisation” and the Council will seek to learn from adverse risk events.   An insurance \nprogramme is also in place to cover insurable risks.  See below for further information (paragraph \n16 and 17).", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 8}
{"text": "9 \n \nRISK FINANCING \n16. Risk Financing is the  process which determines the optimal balance between retaining and \ntransferring risk within an organisation. It also addresses the financial management of retained \nrisk and may best be defined as money consumed in losses, funded either from internal resources \nor from the purchase  of ‘external’ insurance (such as the catastrophe co ver provided by the \nCouncil’s external insurers ). Simply put, it is how an organis ation will pay for loss events in the \nmost effective and least costly way possible. Risk financing involves the identification of risks, \ndetermining how to finance the risk, and monitoring the effectiveness of the financing technique \nchosen. Commercial insurance policies and self -insurance are options for risk transfer schemes \nthough the effectiveness of each de pends on the size of the organisation, the organis ation’s \nfinancial situation, the risks that the organisation faces, and the organisation’s overall objectives. \nRisk financing seeks to choose the option t hat is the least costly, but th at also ensures that the \norganisation has the financial resources available to continue its objectives after a loss event \noccurs.  The Council’s Insurance Services team currently takes cover  with external insurers for \nthe following categories of insurable risk: \n Casualty (Employers Liability and Public Liability) \n \n Property inc. Terrorism \n \n Motor \n \n Fidelity Guarantee \n \n Engineering \n \n Professional Negligence \n \n Official Indemnity \n \n Personal Accident \n \n Fine Arts \n \n17. LCC’s strategy for risk financing is to maintain an insurance fund and only externally  insure for \ncatastrophe cover. The Council’s strategy is to review the balance between external/internal cover \non an annual basis in the light of market condit ions and claims experience.  This balance will be \ninfluenced by the effectiveness of the risk management process embedded at the Council.  \n \n \nRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  \n \n18. The Council’s strategic and individual divisional operational objectives are the starting point for \nthe management of risk.  Managers should not think about risk in isolation but consider events \nthat might affect the Council’s achievement of its objectives. Strategic risks are linked to strategic \nobjectives and o perational risks linked to divisional service delivery objectives, therefore,  risks \nthat could result from day to day activities need, as a minimum, to be identified and monitored.  \nThis is best done by the effective implementation of the risk management process with the use of \nrisk assessments/risk registers  (Appendix 3a for the reporting of service, divisional and \nstrategic risks via a risk register – see paragraph 34 for detail ) which must be maintained \nand updated on a continuous basis and reviewed formally , every 4 months as per the reporting \ncycle at divisional and strategic level.  However, at management level and below this will be more \nfrequent.  An action plan  should be in place  to address the controls raised in the risk \nregister/assessment.  A formal action plan  is compulsory for each strategic risk (See \nAppendix 4 for control plan template).  \n \n19.

The risk management process is explained in detail in  the ‘Identifying and Assessing \nOperational Risk’ training course, which is now mandatory for staff completing a risk assessment \n(see Appendix 5 for the 2024 training schedule) and allows staff to: - \n \n Identify risk, and controls – Officers identify risks and consequences through brainstorming \ndiscussions as a group, or discussion with their staff , interviews, seek employee feedback, \nanalyse customer complaints, internal/external audit reports,  checklists, flowcharts, risk \nregisters, risk assessment workshop write ups,  scenario analysis and SWOT/PESTLE \nanalysis. Controls should be considered and evidenced to manage each risk for the write up \nof the risk assessment; \n \n Assess/Analyse/Evaluate - management assess the likelihood of risks o ccurring and the \nimpact on the council/their service objectives using the Council’s approved risk assessment \nform and the 5x5 scoring methodology .  Once the risks are scored, this will determine \nwhether the risk s are high, medium or low which will help in the prioritisation of risks for \nurgent attention (see Appendix 2); \n \n Manage - management determine the best way to mana ge their risks e.g. terminate, treat, \ntransfer, tolerate or take the opportunity (see paragraph 26 below); \n \n Record risks – using corporate risk assessment template to record risks (see Appendix 3); \nUse Appendix 3 if you are risk assessing for a project/activity /initiative or Appendix 3A for \nreporting risks via the risk register tool; \n \nIdentify \nRisk \nAssess \nRisk \nManage \nRisk \nMonito\nr Risk \nRecord in Risk Register \nReport to management \nand members \n \nReview \nReview \nThe Risk Management Cycle", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 10}
{"text": "11 \n \n Monitor – management should monitor their risks and the effectiveness of their identified \nmanagement controls; are controls implemented and need for further controls; \n \n Review - management ensure identified risks are regularly reviewed  and if controls have \nbeen implemented, whether further controls are necessary or required. This will normally be \nmanaged by means of a risk register (see paragraphs 30 - 40 below for more detail). \n \n Risk Reporting, communication and consultation: Communication and consultation with \nexternal and internal stakeholders should take place during all stages of the risk \nmanagement process using the risk register/assessment as a reporting tool. \n \nREBR are available to support this process either by attending or facilitating risk ‘workshops’ or \ndelivering risk identification and mitigation training to managers and their business teams . \n \n \nIDENTIFYING THE RISKS \n \n23. In order to identify risks, we need to focus on the aims and objectives of the Council  and of any \nproject and activity that contributes to those.  Risk is simply defined as ‘the effect of uncertainty \non objectives’ – ISO31000 Risk Management Standard.  As mentioned in paragraph  22, the \ntraining session covers in detail  how to identify risks.  Please refer to Appendix 3 for the risk \nassessment template to log risks and its evaluation. Appendix 6 indicates the different PESTLE \ncategories of risk  and Appendix 6A are further prompts  which staff can utilise to identify risks  \nthat are internal/external facing.  However, it is not an exhaustive list and officers are reminded \nthat risks may not be present in all categories w hen they are completing their risk assessment.  \nOther means of identifying risks include previously completed risk assessments, brainstorming \nexercises involving the relevant stakeholders, complaints received, claims, incident and accident \nreports.    This is discussed in more detail in the training sessions.  Also, staff may need to consider \ncarrying out a dynamic risk assessment as and when required, for e.g. in the case of inclement \nweather, the original risk assessment may not have considered how to operate on a wet day as \nit was not anticipated.   \n \nControls need to be considered and evidenced in the risk assessment/template before \nthe next step (as stated in paragraph 21, LCC assess risks with controls in place) \n \n \nASSESS / ANALYSE AND EVALUATE RISKS \n \n24. The primary function of “scoring” risks is to facilitate their prioritisation and assessment against \nrisk appetite.  This step involves determining the likeli hood of the risk occurring and its impact \nshould it occur.  Please see Appendix 2 for further detail of the scoring mechanism and  the \ndefinitions utilised at LCC to calculate the level of the risk: - Impact x Likelihood = Risk score.   \n \n   \n25. This helps to prioritise the risks  (risk ranking) which require urgent action using a red, amber, \ngreen scoring mechanism (RAG status).  The table below indicates how risks that are high, \nmedium and low should be managed.         \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLEVEL OF RISK OVERALL \nRATING \nHOW THE RISK SHOULD BE TACKLED/ MANAGED \nHigh Risk 15-25 IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT ACTION  \n \nMedium Risk 9-12 Plan for CHANGE  \nLow Risk 1-8 Continue to MANAGE", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 11}

Once risks and controls have been identified and assessed by management with controls in place \n(a risk rating score has been derived ), managers should then determine how those risks will \nbe dealt with – a process commonly known as the four T’s.  The risk rating score will also enable \nrisks to be prioritised and influence the use of one or more of the four T’s –  \n \n Terminate  \n \n Treat \n \n Tolerate  \n \n Transfer \n \nPlease see below charts for possible actions after assessing and analysis of risks:  \n \n \n \n \n4 T’s \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nImpact \n  \nHigh \n \nTransfer \nTransfer risk to another \nparty, outsource, insurance \n \nTerminate \nStop the activity or do it \ndifferently using alternative \nsystems \n \n \n \n \nLow \nTolerate \nBear losses out of normal \noperating costs following an \ninformed decision to retain \nrisk, monitor situation \nTreat \nImplement procedures and \ncontrols to reduce the \nfrequency or the severity; \nformulate a contingency plan \nto reduce service interruption \n  \n \n \nLow High \n   Likelihood", "source": "App 1 Risk Policy and Strategy 2024.pdf", "page": 12}

Taking the opportunity is an enhancement to this process. This option is not an alternative to the \nabove; rather it is an option which should be considered whenever tolerating, transferring or \ntreating a risk. There are two considerations here: \n \n Consider whether at the same time as mitigating a threat, an opportunity arises to exploit \npositive impact. For example, if a large sum of capital funding is to be put at risk in a major \nproject, are the relevant controls good en ough to justify increasing the sum at stake to gain \neven greater advantage? \n \n Consider also, whether circumstances arise which, whilst not generating threats, offer \npositive opportunities. For example, a drop in the cost of goods or services frees up resource \nwhich may be able to be redeployed for projects that enhance the economy of Leicester. \n \n28. Secondary Risk - It’s important to note  that it's common for efforts to reduce risk to have risks \nof their own. These are known as secondary risks. For example, if a project is \noutsourced/subcontracted a number of secondary risks will be assumed such as the risk that the \noutsourcing company/subcontractor will fail to deliver. \n \n \nRISK TREATMENT AND DECISION MAKING \n \n29. Risk controls and treatment options  (4Ts – paragraph 26) should be identified by those who are \ndirectly involved in the management of the activity or by experts who have detailed knowledge of \nthe underlying risks and who have actively engaged in the risk identification and evaluation \nprocess.  Risk control options should be evaluated as the wrong choice can be difficult to unwind.   \n \n \nMONITORING AND REVIEWING THE RISKS \n \n30. After evaluating the measures already in place to mitigate and control the risk(s) , there may still \nbe some remaining exposure to risk (residual risk). It is important to stress that such exposure is \nnot necessarily detrimental to the Council and ensures that the Council is  aware of its  key \nbusiness risks; what controls are in place to manage (mitigate) these risks; and what the potential \nimpact of any residual risk exposure is . This step in the risk process never really ends as \nmonitoring and review of your risk assessment to ensure it stays valid is an ongoing process.

To \nsummarise, are the controls being implemented, are they effective  and is the business \nrequirement being met, has the risk changed, do further controls need to be considered, therefore, \nre-scoring of the risk, and do new risks need to be incorporated or any existing ones deleted.  \n \n31. It is important that those risks that have been identified as requiring action are subject to periodic \nreview, to assess whether the risk of an event or occurrence still remains acceptable and if further \ncontrols are needed.  Any further a ction(s) should be determined, noted and implemented. The \nfrequency of reviews should be decided by management, depending on the type and value of the \nrisks identified (see also 32 below). Currently, at LC C, the significant strategic and operational \nrisks are reviewed and reported on a  4 monthly basis to CMT and bi-annually to the G&AC, with \nstrategic risks reported 4 monthly to the City Mayor and Executive,  facilitated by the Manager, \nRisk Management.

Significant operational risks (scoring 15 and above) should continue to be logged and monitored \nvia the Operational Risk Register  (ORR). It is the responsibility of each divisional director to \nensure that operational risks are recorded and monitored via a risk register. These registers and \nthe risks identified are aligned to the Council’s operating structure. REBR has produced a pro-\nforma risk assessment/register that must be used by all business areas (see Appendix 3/3A). \nEvery divisional director is required to use the newly updated Risk Register  highlighting which \nstrategic risk the identified divisional risk has an impact on and the PESTLE category it falls under \nwhere possible.    \n \n33. The most significant risks (those scored 15 and above) identified by the divisional directors feed \ninto the council’s ORR which is  managed by  CMT and facilitated by the Manager, Risk \nManagement, REBR . CMT is accountable for ensuring that all operational risks are identified \nagainst service delivery objectives; that plan s are implemented to control the se exposures; key \nrisks are included within the individual service plan  and that monitoring and communication of \nrisks takes place.  \n \n34.

The most significant of these risks, those that \nmay threaten the Council’s overall strategic aims, form this register which is reviewed and updated \nby directors every four months.  As part of the overall process of escalation, each strategic director \nshould also have risk on their 121 agenda with their divisional directors at least quarterly and with \nlead Executive members . One of the significant strategic risks is a seriou s failing of the \nmanagement of operational risks by divisional directors.  \n \n35. REBR facilitates and supports this process and will continue to maintain the SRR/ORR, using the \ninput from each Divisional  Risk Register and the updates provided by the strategic  director for \nthe SRR. The SRR/ORR will be reported 4-monthly to CMT, and bi-annually to the G&AC. In \naddition, the SRR is also reported to the City Mayor / Executive 4-monthly.  As part of this process, \nbespoke training needs may be identified and the REBR team will provide training and support  \nupon request. \n \n36. The process for reviewing and reporting operational and strategic risks at LCC is set out as below: \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \nKey: \nDRR –  Divisional Risk Registers – compiled using most significant operational risks from \nHeads of Service risk registers.   \n  \nORR –  Operational Risk Registers – produced by REBR using the significant risks from the \nDRRs submitted by Divisional Directors \n \nSRR –  Strategic Risk Registers – compiled by REBR using significant risks submitted by \nDirectors and are those risks that may affect achievement of the council’s strategic \naims. \n \n37.  All risks identified, both operational and strategic, will need to be tracked and monitored by regular \nreviews of the risk registers at 121’s with management. This will ensure that any changes in risks \nThe Manager, Risk Management, \nREBR  submits the council’s SRR \n/ORR to the Board for final approval  \nand  the SRR only to CMB 4-\nmonthly.

However, this is not to become a b ureaucratic process and to put it into perspective, \nthe DRR’s are revised for 4-monthly reporting to CMT and Executive.   \n \n39. Document Retention - It is recommended to save a new copy of the updated risk register rather \nthan overwriting the existing one so that an audit trail of reviews can be evidenced. \n \n40. To improve the process of risk management, it is worth Divisional Directors noting any emerging \nrisks on the Divisional Register on a separate worksheet. These emerging risks may not be a risk \ncurrently but may be so in the future. This is good risk management practice.  \n \n \nPARTNERSHIP RISK \n \n41.  It is recognised that partnership working is a key area where associated risk needs to be identified \nand controlled. Best practice states that local authorities must meet two key responsibilities for \neach partnership they have. They must: - \n \n Provide assurance that the risks associated with working in partnership with another \norganisation have been identified and prioritised and are appropriately managed (partnership \nrisks); \n \n Ensure that the individual partnership members have effective risk management procedures \nin place (individual partner risks). \n    \n \nRISK MANAGEMENT TRAINING \n \n42. An annual programme of training (covering risk and business continuity planning) is available to \nall staff,  managers and m embers. However, directors and m anagers should identify staff who \nrequire this training through the staff a ppraisal process  (existing staff)  and through the jobs \nspecification process (new staff) and appropriate training will be provide d by REBR.

To achieve this, priority exposures should be identified, addressed, and incorporated \ninto appropriate risk management strategies and risk improvements into  organisation’s service \ndelivery.   A robust risk process will allow identification of emerging risks and horizon scanning. \nThis should be in line  with the Council’s priorities. This helps to determine how risks affect such \npriorities, whether to consider changes in  Council operations and to enable us to make well -\ninformed decisions. Risk must be considered as an inte gral part  of divisional planning, \nperformance management, financial planning and strategic policy-making processes. The cultural \nperception of ri sk management must continue changing from a ‘have -to-do’ to a ‘need -to-do’. \nHowever, this does not need to become a bureaucratic and paper intensive exercise and \njudgment by the appropriate person should be exercised. \n \n47. The Manager, Risk Management, REBR will continue to maintain a central copy of the SRR/ORR \nas well as the DRR ’s. Internal Audit will continu e to utilise these registers to assist them in \ndeveloping the audit plan and producing a programme of audits, which will test how well risk is \nmanaged within specific areas of the business  – subject to resource being available. The \nCouncil’s Risk Strategy and Policy will help directors to report appropriately upon their risk and \ntheir risk registers, together with other information gathered by Internal Audit through \nconsultations, will be used to formulate the audit work programme which, in turn, allows assurance \nto be given to both the CMT (officers) and the Governance and Audit Committee (members) that \nrisk is being properly identified and managed at LCC.  \n  \n48.

{"text": "Introduction | The Orange Book\n3\nIn successful organisations, risk \nmanagement enhances strategic planning \nand prioritisation, assists in achieving \nobjectives and strengthens the ability \nto be agile to respond to the challenges \nfaced. If we are serious about meeting \nobjectives successfully, improving \nservice delivery and achieving value for \nmoney, risk management must be an \nessential and integral part of planning and \ndecision‑making. While risk practices have \nimproved over time across government, \nthe volatility, complexity and ambiguity of \nour operating environment has increased, \nas have demands for greater transparency \nand accountability for managing the impact \nof risks.\nPart I: Management of Risk – Principles \nand Concepts builds on the original \nOrange Book to help improve risk \nmanagement further and to embed this \nas a routine part of how we operate.\nPart II: To help organisations have an \neffective and efficient approach to risk \ncontrol, Part II provides a structure \nto illustrate, in principle, how existing \nhigh level control requirements can be \ncategorised and adherence to them \nassured. \nPublic Sector organisations cannot be risk averse \nand be successful. Risk is inherent in everything \nwe do to deliver high-quality services. Effective \nand meaningful risk management in government \nremains as important as ever in taking a balanced \nview to managing opportunity and risk. It must be \nan integral part of informed decision-making; from \npolicy or project inception through implementation \nto the everyday delivery of public services. \nAt its most effective, risk management is as \nmuch about evaluating the uncertainties and \nimplications within options as it is about managing \nimpacts once choices are made. It is about \nbeing realistic in the assessment of the risks to \nprojects and programmes and in the consideration \nof the effectiveness of the actions taken to \nmanage these risks.\nThis isn’t about adding new processes; it is \nabout ensuring that effective risk management is \nintegrated in the way we lead, direct, manage and \noperate. As an integrated part of our management \nsystems, and through the normal flow of \ninformation, an organisation’s risk management \nframework harnesses the activities that identify and \nmanage the uncertainties faced and systematically \nanticipate and prepare successful responses. Its \nimportance and value to success should not be \nunderestimated.\nAs with all aspects of good governance, \nthe effectiveness of risk management depends \non the individuals responsible for operating \nthe systems put in place. Our risk culture must \nembrace openness, support transparency, \nwelcome constructive challenge and promote \ncollaboration, consultation and co-operation. \nWe must invite scrutiny and embrace expertise \nto inform decision-making. We must also invest in \nthe necessary capabilities and seek to continually \nlearn from experience.\nThis updated guidance has benefited from \ndiscussions with stakeholders and practitioners \nacross the public sector and with colleagues from \nthe private sector.

The aim is to understand \nthe organisation’s overall risk profile. \nThe organisation can use a range of techniques \nfor identifying specific risks that may potentially \nimpact on one or more objectives. The following \nfactors, and the relationship between these \nfactors, should also be considered:\n• tangible and intangible sources of risk\n• changes in the external and \ninternal context\n• uncertainties and assumptions within \noptions, strategies, plans, etc\n• indicators of emerging risks\n• limitations of knowledge and reliability \nof information\n• any potential biases and beliefs \nof those involved\nRisks should be identified whether or not \ntheir sources are under the organisation’s \ndirect control. Even seemingly insignificant \nrisks on their own have the potential, as they \ninteract with other events and conditions, \nto cause great damage or create significant \nopportunity.\nD3 While each risk identified may be important, \nsome form of measurement is necessary \nto evaluate their significance to support \ndecision-making. Without a standard for \ncomparison, it is not possible to compare \nand aggregate risks across the organisation \nand its extended enterprise. This prioritisation \nis supported by risk assessment[10], which \nincorporates risk analysis and risk evaluation.\nD4 The purpose of risk analysis is to support \na detailed consideration of the nature and \nlevel of risk. The risk analysis process should \nuse a common set of risk criteria to foster \nconsistent interpretation and application \nin defining the level of risk, based on the \nassessment of the likelihood of the risk \noccurring and the consequences should the \nevent happen (see Annex 5).\nD5 Risk analysis can be undertaken with varying \ndegrees of detail and complexity, depending \non the purpose of the analysis, the availability \nand reliability of evidence and the resources \navailable.

In an ever-changing \nenvironment, with new risks emerging and systems \nand controls changing, procedures and policies \nmust be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure \nthat they remain fit for purpose.\nThe Risk Control Framework does not change \naccounting officer responsibilities but should make \nit easier for accounting officers, their management \nteams, functional leaders, audit and risk assurance \ncommittees, and boards to demonstrate that these \nresponsibilities are being discharged appropriately.\nPurpose of the Risk Control Framework \n(RCF)\nTo help organisations have an effective and \nefficient approach to risk control, the RCF provides \nstructure to existing requirements which should \nhelp accounting officers:\ni in being confident in their control activities \nand\nii when prioritising control improvements. \nIt should also help strengthen decision making and \nsupport the management of risks taken to fulfil their \nduties.

The second line should support \nmanagement by bringing expertise, process \nexcellence, and monitoring alongside the first line \nto help ensure that risks are effectively managed.\nThe second line should have a defined and \nproportionate approach to ensure requirements \nare applied effectively and appropriately. \nThis would typically include compliance \nassessments or reviews carried out to determine \nthat standards\n5, expectations, policy and/or \nregulatory considerations are being met in line with \nexpectations across the organisation.\nWhere they exist, Assurance Teams (typically from \nthe second line as third line assurance is provided \nby Internal Audit) usually:\n• Lead and coordinate the assurance mapping \nand delivery activity, including consolidating \nand reporting results to committees\n• Agree and refine wording of questions to \nbe used locally each year, with help from \nSubject Matter Experts (SME), specifying \n‘what good looks like’ locally in terms of \ncontrols and evidence\n• Set the rating mechanisms and \nformatting requirements to be used for \nassurance findings\n• Pursue areas requiring improvements, \nensuring actions taken e.g., development of \nmanagement information (such as reports \non staff undertaking mandated training)\n• Attend challenge meetings with \nDirector Generals (DGs) and other \nsenior business leaders\n• Undertake other duties as appropriate \nfor their organisation\n5 In addition to professional standards, functional standards guide people working in and with the UK government. They exist to \ncreate a coherent and mutually understood way of doing business across organisational boundaries, and to provide a stable \nbasis for assurance, risk management, and capability improvement.", "source": "HMT_Orange_Book_May_2023.pdf", "page": 50}
{"text": "Annex 2: The Three Lines Model |  The Orange Book\n49\nThird line Roles\nInternal audit form the organisation’s “third line \nrole”. An independent internal audit function[15] \nwill, through a risk-based approach to its work, \nprovide an objective evaluation of how effectively \nthe organisation assesses and manages its risks, \nincluding the design and operation of the “first and \nsecond lines of defence”. It should encompass \nall elements of the risk management framework \nand should include in its potential scope all risk \nand control activities. Internal audit may also \nprovide assurance over the management of \ncross-organisational risks and support the sharing \nof good practice between organisations, subject \nto considering the privacy and confidentiality \nof information.\nExternal assurance\nSitting outside of the organisation’s own risk \nmanagement framework and the three lines model, \nare a range of other sources of assurance that \nsupport an organisation’s understanding and \nassessment of its management of risks and its \noperation of controls, including:\n• external auditors, chiefly the National \nAudit Office (NAO)\n6, who have a statutory \nresponsibility for certification audit of the \nfinancial statements\n• value for money studies undertaken \nby the NAO, which Parliament use to \nhold government to account for how it \nspends public money\n• the Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA), \nwho arrange and manage independent expert \nassurance reviews of major government \nprojects that provide critical input to \nHM Treasury business case appraisal and \nfinancial approval points\n6 Some executive NDPBs may have private sector external auditors (either appointed by the relevant Secretary of State \nor by the Body’s Executive) with a reporting line directly to the Secretary of State or to the body rather than through NAO \nto Parliament.\nOther sources of independent external assurance \nmay include independent inspection bodies, \nexternal system accreditation reviews/certification \n(e.g. ISO), and HM Treasury/Cabinet Office/\nParliamentary activities that support scrutiny and \napproval processes.\nCoordination, cooperation and \ncommunication\nThese three line roles have a common objective: \nto help the organisation achieve its objectives with \neffective management of risks. They often deal with \nthe same risk and control issues. The accounting \nofficer and the board should clearly communicate \ntheir expectation that information be shared and \nactivities co-ordinated across each of the ‘lines’ \nwhere this does not diminish the effectiveness or \nobjectivity of any of those involved.\nCareful coordination is necessary to avoid \nunnecessary duplication of efforts, while \nassuring that all significant risks are addressed \nappropriately. Coordination may take a variety of \nforms depending on the nature of the organisation \nand the specific work done by each party. It is \nlikely to be helpful to adopt a common ‘language’ \nor set of definitions across the ‘lines model’ to \nease understanding, for example, in defining risk \ncategories, risk criteria and what is an acceptance \nlevel of control or a significant control weakness.\nInternal audit and external audit should work \neffectively together to the maximum benefit of the \norganisation and in line with international\n[16] and \npublic sector standards.", "source": "HMT_Orange_Book_May_2023.pdf", "page": 51}

{"text": "Annex 5: Definitions and Supportive Concepts  | The Orange Book\n59\nIn stating risks, care should be taken to avoid \nstating consequences that may arise as being the \nrisks themselves, i.e. identifying the symptoms \nwithout their cause(s). Equally, care should be \ntaken to avoid defining risks with statements that \nare simply the converse of the objectives, i.e. \nfailure to achieve the intended output/outcome.\nOrganisations typically assess consequences using \na combination of criteria, which commonly include \nfinancial, reputational, legal, regulatory, safety, \nsecurity, environmental, employee, customer \nand operational effects. The criteria used should \nbe dynamic and should be periodically reviewed \nand amended, as necessary. Scales should \nallow meaningful differentiation for ranking and \nprioritisation purposes based on assigning values \nto each risk using the defined criteria.\nWhen assigning a consequence rating to a risk, \nthe rating for the highest, most credible worst-case \nscenario should be assigned.\nThe risk analysis process defines the level of risk, \nbased on the assessment of the likelihood of \nthe risk occurring and the consequences should \nthe event happen. Likelihood is the assessment \nof something happening, whether defined, \nmeasured or determined objectively or subjectively, \nqualitatively or quantitatively, and described \nusing general terms or mathematically (such as a \nprobability or a frequency over a given time period).\nRisk analysis should also consider:\n• sensitivity and confidence levels, \nbased on the information available\n• complexity and connectivity\n• time-related factors and volatility\n• the effectiveness of existing internal control\nInternal Control is the dynamic and iterative \nframework of processes, policies, procedures, \nactivities, devices, practices, or other conditions \nand/or actions that maintain and/or modify risk. \nInternal controls permeate and are inherent in the \nway the organisation operates and are affected by \ncultural and behavioural factors.\nWhere additional action is required to bring the \nlevels of risk within the nature and extent that \nthe organisation is willing to take to achieve its \nobjectives, the organisation should select, develop \nand implement options for addressing risk through \npreventive, directive, detective, and/or corrective \ncontrols that manage risks to an acceptable level. \nThese might be manual or automated. This involves \nan iterative process of:\n• planning and implementing internal control\n• assessing the effectiveness of internal control\n• deciding whether the nature and extent of \nthe remaining risk after the implementation \nof internal controls is acceptable\n• if not acceptable, reassessing options and \ntaking further action where appropriate\nInternal control, even if carefully designed and \nimplemented, might not produce the intended \nor expected outcomes. Internal control can also \nintroduce new risks that need to be managed.\nAssurance is a general term for the confidence \nthat can be derived from objective information over \nthe successful conduct of activities, the efficient \nand effective design and operation of internal \ncontrol, compliance with internal and external \nrequirements, and the production of insightful \nand credible information to support decision-\nmaking.

This document, together with the document Basel III: International framework for \nliquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring , presents the Basel Committee’s 1 \nreforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity  rules with the goal of promoting a more \nresilient banking sector. The objective of the reforms is to improve the banking sector’s ability \nto absorb shocks arising from financial and ec onomic stress, whatever the source, thus \nreducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. This document \nsets out the rules text and timelines to implement the Basel III framework. \n2. The Committee’s comprehensive reform package addresses the lessons of the \nfinancial crisis. Through its reform package, the Committee also aims to improve risk \nmanagement and governance as well as streng then banks’ transparency and disclosures.\n2 \nMoreover, the reform package includes the Committee’s efforts to strengthen the resolution \nof systemically significant cross-border banks.\n3 \n3. A strong and resilient banking system is the foundation for sustainable economic \ngrowth, as banks are at the centre of the cr edit intermediation process between savers and \ninvestors. Moreover, banks provide critical services to consumers, small and medium-sized \nenterprises, large corporate firms and governments who rely on them to conduct their daily \nbusiness, both at a domestic and international level.  \n4. One of the main reasons the economic and financial crisis, which began in 2007, \nbecame so severe was that the banking sectors of many countries had built up excessive on- \nand off-balance sheet leverage. This was accompanied by a gradual erosion of the level and \nquality of the capital base. At the same time, many banks were holding insufficient liquidity \nbuffers. The banking system therefore was not able to absorb the resulting systemic trading \nand credit losses nor could it cope with the reintermediation of large off-balance sheet \nexposures that had built up in the shadow banking system. The crisis was further amplified \nby a procyclical deleveraging process and by t he interconnectedness of systemic institutions \nthrough an array of complex transactions. During the most severe episode of the crisis, the \nmarket lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of many banking institutions. The \nweaknesses in the banking sector were rapidly transmitted to the rest of the financial system \nand the real economy, resulting in a massive cont raction of liquidity and credit availability. \nUltimately the public sector had to step in with unprecedented injections of liquidity, capital \nsupport and guarantees, exposing taxpayers to large losses.  \n                                                \n \n1 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision consists of senior representatives of bank supervisory \nauthorities and central banks from Ar gentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,  Canada, China, France, Germany, \nHong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kore a, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi \nArabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Swit zerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United \nStates.

The effect on banks, financial systems and economies at the epicentre of the crisis \nwas immediate. However, the crisis also spread to a wider circle of countries around the \nglobe. For these countries the transmission channels were less direct, resulting from a \nsevere contraction in global liquidity, cro ss-border credit availability and demand for exports. \nGiven the scope and speed with which the recent and previous crises have been transmitted \naround the globe as well as the unpredictable nature of future crises, it is critical that all \ncountries raise the resilience of their banking sectors to both internal and external shocks. \n6. To address the market failures revealed by the crisis, the Committee is introducing a \nnumber of fundamental reforms to the international regulatory framework. The reforms \nstrengthen bank-level, or microprudential, regulation, which will help raise the resilience of \nindividual banking institutions to periods of stress. The reforms also have a macroprudential \nfocus, addressing system-wide risks that can build up across the banking sector as well as \nthe procyclical amplification of these risks over time. Clearly these micro and \nmacroprudential approaches to supervision are interrelated, as greater resilience at the \nindividual bank level reduces the risk of system-wide shocks.  \nA.  Strengthening the global capital framework \n7.  The Basel Committee is raising the resilience of the banking sector by \nstrengthening the regulatory capital framework, building on the three pillars of the Basel II \nframework. The reforms raise both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and \nenhance the risk coverage of the capital framework. They are underpinned by a leverage \nratio that serves as a backstop to the risk-based capital measures, is intended to constrain \nexcess leverage in the banking system and provide an extra layer of protection against \nmodel risk and measurement error. Finally, t he Committee is introducing a number of \nmacroprudential elements into the capital framework to help contain systemic risks arising \nfrom procyclicality and from the interconnectedness of financial institutions.  \n1. Raising the quality, consistency and transparency of the capital base \n8. It is critical that banks’ risk exposure\ns are backed by a high quality capital base. The \ncrisis demonstrated that credit losses and writedowns come out of retained earnings, which \nis part of banks’ tangible common equity base. It also revealed the inconsistency in the \ndefinition of capital across jurisdictions and th e lack of disclosure that would have enabled \nthe market to fully assess and compare the quality of capital between institutions. \n9. To this end, the predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common shares and \nretained earnings. This standard is reinforced through a set of principles that also can be \ntailored to the context of non-joint stock companies to ensure they hold comparable levels of \nhigh quality Tier 1 capital. Deductions from capital and prudential filters have been \nharmonised internationally and generally appli ed at the level of common equity or its \nequivalent in the case of non-joint stock companies. The remainder of the Tier 1 capital base \nmust be comprised of instruments that are subordinated, have fully discretionary non-\ncumulative dividends or coupons and have neither a maturity date nor an incentive to \nredeem.

The Committee is introducing these changes in a manner that minimises the \ndisruption to capital instruments that are currently outstanding. It also continues to review the \nrole that contingent capital should play in the regulatory capital framework.  \n2. Enhancing risk coverage  \n11. One of the key lessons of the crisis has been the need  to strength\nen the risk \ncoverage of the capital framework. Failure to capture major on- and off-balance sheet risks, \nas well as derivative related exposures, was a key destabilising factor during the crisis.  \n12. In response to these shortcomings, the Committee in July 2009 completed a number \nof critical reforms to the Basel II framework. These reforms will raise capital requirements for \nthe trading book and complex securitisation exposures, a major source of losses for many \ninternationally active banks. The enhanced treatment introduces a stressed value-at-risk \n(VaR) capital requirement based on a continuous 12-month period of significant financial \nstress. In addition, the Committee has introduced higher capital requirements for so-called \nresecuritisations in both the banking and the trading book. The reforms also raise the \nstandards of the Pillar 2 supervisory review process and strengthen Pillar 3 disclosures. The \nPillar 1 and Pillar 3 enhancements must be implemented by the end of 2011; the Pillar 2 \nstandards became effective when they were introduced in July 2009.  The Committee is also \nconducting a fundamental review of the trading book. The work on the fundamental review of \nthe trading book is targeted for completion by year-end 2011. \n13. This document also introduces measures to strengthen the capital requirements for \ncounterparty credit exposures arising from banks’ derivatives, repo and securities financing \nactivities. These reforms will raise the capital buffers backing these exposures, reduce \nprocyclicality and provide additional incentives to move OTC derivative contracts to central \ncounterparties, thus helping r educe systemic risk across the financial system. They also \nprovide incentives to strengthen the risk management of counterparty credit exposures. \n14. To this end, the Committee is introducing the following reforms: \n(a) Going forward, banks must determine their capital requirement for counterparty \ncredit risk using stressed inputs. This will address concerns about capital charges \nbecoming too low during periods of compressed market volatility and help address \nprocyclicality. The approach, which is similar to what has been introduced for market \nrisk, will also promote more integrated management of market and counterparty \ncredit risk.  \n(b) Banks will be subject to a capital charge for potential mark-to-market losses (ie \ncredit valuation adjustment – CVA – risk) associated with a deterioration in the credit \nworthiness of a counterparty. While the Basel II standard covers the risk of a \ncounterparty default, it does not address such CVA risk, which during the financial \ncrisis was a greater source of losses than those arising from outright defaults.  \n(c) The Committee is strengthening standards for collateral management and initial \nmargining. Banks with large and illiquid derivative exposures to a counterparty will \nhave to apply longer margining periods as a basis for determining the regulatory \ncapital requirement. Additional standards have been adopted to strengthen collateral \nrisk management practices.  \n(d) To address the", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 11}

The \ncapitalisation of bank exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) will be based in \npart on the compliance of the CCP with such standards, and will be finalised after a \nconsultative process in 2011. A bank’s collateral and mark-to-market exposures to \nCCPs meeting these enhanced principles will be subject to a low risk weight, \nproposed at 2%; and default fund exposures to CCPs will be subject to risk-sensitive \ncapital requirements. These criteria, together with strengthened capital requirements \nfor bilateral OTC derivative exposures, will create strong incentives for banks to \nmove exposures to such CCPs. Moreover, to address systemic risk within the \nfinancial sector, the Committee also is raising the risk weights on exposures to \nfinancial institutions relative to the non-financial corporate sector, as financial \nexposures are more highly correlated than non-financial ones.  \n(e) The Committee is raising counterparty credit risk management standards in a \nnumber of areas, including for the treatment of so-called wrong-way risk, ie cases \nwhere the exposure increases when the credit quality of the counterparty \ndeteriorates. It also issued final additional guidance for the sound backtesting of \ncounterparty credit exposures. \n15. Finally, the Committee assessed a number of measures to mitigate the reliance on \nexternal ratings of the Basel II framework. The measures include requirements for banks to \nperform their own internal assessments of ex ternally rated securitisation exposures, the \nelimination of certain “cliff effects” associated with credit risk mitigation practices, and the \nincorporation of key elements of the IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit \nRating Agencies into the Committee’s eligibility criteria for the use of external ratings in the \ncapital framework. The Committee also is conducting a more fundamental review of the \nsecuritisation framework, including its reliance on external ratings. \n3. Supplementing the risk-based capital requirement with a leverage ratio \n16. One of the underlying features of the cr isis was the build up of excessive on- an d\n \noff-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. The build up of leverage also has been a \nfeature of previous financial crises, for example leading up to September 1998. During the \nmost severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its \nleverage in a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating \nthe positive feedback loop between losses, declines in bank capital, and the contraction in \ncredit availability. The Committee therefore is introducing a leverage ratio requirement that is \nintended to achieve the following objectives: \n constrain leverage in the banking sector, thus helping to mitigate the risk of the \ndestabilising deleveraging processes wh ich can damage the financial system and \nthe economy; and  \n introduce additional safeguards against model risk and measurement error by \nsupplementing the risk-based measure with a simple, transparent, independent \nmeasure of risk.   \n17.

{"text": "Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 5\n \n \n4. Reducing procyclicality and promoting countercyclical buffers \n18. One of the most destabilising elements of the crisis has been the procyclical \namplification of financial shocks throughout the banking system, financial markets and the \nbroader economy. The tendency of market parti cipants to behave in a procyclical manner \nhas been amplified through a variety of channels, including through accounting standards for \nboth mark-to-market assets and held-to-maturity loans, margining practices, and through the \nbuild up and release of leverage among financial institutions, firms, and consumers. The \nBasel Committee is introducing a number of measures to make banks more resilient to such \nprocyclical dynamics. These measur es will help ensure that the banking sector serves as a \nshock absorber, instead of a transmitter of risk to the financial system and broader economy.  \n19. In addition to the leverage ratio discussed in the previous section, the Committee is \nintroducing a series of measures to address procyclicality and raise the resilience of the \nbanking sector in good times. These measures have the following key objectives: \n dampen any excess cyclicality of the minimum capital requirement; \n promote more forward looking provisions; \n conserve capital to build buffers at individual banks and the banking sector that can \nbe used in stress; and \n achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the banking sector from \nperiods of excess credit growth. \nCyclicality of the minimum requirement \n20. The Basel II framework increased the risk sensit ivity and coverage of the regulatory \ncapital requ\nirement. Indeed, one of the most procyclical dynamics has been the failure of risk \nmanagement and capital frameworks to capture key exposures – such as complex trading \nactivities, resecuritisations and exposures to of f-balance sheet vehicles – in advance of the \ncrisis. However, it is not possible to achieve gr eater risk sensitivity across institutions at a \ngiven point in time without introducing a certain degree of cyclicality in minimum capital \nrequirements over time. The Committee was aware of this trade-off during the design of the \nBasel II framework and introduced a number of sa feguards to address excess cyclicality of \nthe minimum requirement. They include the requirement to use long term data horizons to \nestimate probabilities of default, the introduction of so called downturn loss-given-default \n(LGD) estimates and the appropriate calibration of the risk functions, which convert loss \nestimates into regulatory capital requirements. The Committee also required that banks \nconduct stress tests that consider the downward migration of their credit portfolios in a \nrecession. \n21. In addition, the Committee has put in place a comprehensive data collection \ninitiative to assess the impact of the Basel II framework on its member countries over the \ncredit cycle. Should the cyclicality of the minimum requirement be greater than supervisors \nconsider appropriate, the Committee will consider additional measures to dampen such \ncyclicality.  \n22. The Committee has reviewed a number of additional measures that supervisors \ncould take to achieve a better balance between risk sensitivity and the stability of capital \nrequirements, should this be viewed as necessary.

The Committee is promoting stronger pr ovisioning practices through three related  \ninitiatives. F\nirst, it is advocating a change in the accounting standards towards an expected \nloss (EL) approach. The Committee strongly supports the initiative of the IASB to move to an \nEL approach. The goal is to improve the usefulness and relevance of financial reporting for \nstakeholders, including prudential regulators. It has issued publicly and made available to the \nIASB a set of high level guiding principles that should govern the reforms to the replacement \nof IAS 39.\n6 The Committee supports an EL approach that captures actual losses more \ntransparently and is also less procyclical than the current “incurred loss” approach. \n24. Second, it is updating its supervisory guidance to be consistent with the move to \nsuch an EL approach. Such guidance will assist supervisors in promoting strong provisioning \npractices under the desired EL approach. \n25. Third, it is addressing incentives to stronger provisioning in the regulatory capital \nframework.  \nCapital conservation \n26. The Committee is introducing a framework to promote the conservation of capital \nand the build-up of adequate buffer\ns above the minimum that can be drawn down in periods \nof stress.  \n27. At the onset of the financial crisis, a number of banks continued to make large \ndistributions in the form of dividends, share buy backs and generous compensation \npayments even though their individual financial condition and the outlook for the sector were \ndeteriorating. Much of this activity was driven by a collectiv e action problem, where \nreductions in distributions were perceived as sending a signal of weakness. However, these \nactions made individual banks and the sector as a whole less resilient. Many banks soon \nreturned to profitability but did not do enough to rebuild their capital buffers to support new \nlending activity. Taken together, this dynamic has increased the procyclicality of the system. \n28. To address this market failure, the Committee is introducing a framework that will \ngive supervisors stronger tools to promote capital conservation in the banking sector. \nImplementation of the framework through internationally agreed capital conservation \nstandards will help increase sector resilience going into a downturn and will provide the \nmechanism for rebuilding capital during the economic recovery.

As witnessed during the financial crisis, losses incurred in t he banking \nsector during \na downturn preceded by a period of excess credi t growth can be extremely large. Such \nlosses can destabilise the banking sector, which can bring about or exacerbate a downturn in \nthe real economy. This in turn can further destabilise the banking sector. These inter-\nlinkages highlight the particular importance of the banking sector building up its capital \ndefences in periods when credit has grown to excessive levels. The building up of these \ndefences should have the additional benefit of helping to moderate excess credit growth.  \n30. The Basel Committee is introducing a regime which will adjust the capital buffer \nrange, established through the capital conservation mechanism outlined in the previous \nsection, when there are signs that credit has grown to excessive levels. The purpose of the \ncountercyclical buffer is to achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the \nbanking sector in periods of excess aggregate credit growth. \n31. The measures to address procyclicality are designed to complement each other. \nThe initiatives on provisioning focus on strengthening the banking system against expected \nlosses, while the capital measures focus on unexpected losses. Among the capital \nmeasures, there is a distinction between addressing the cyclicality of the minimum and \nbuilding additional buffers above that minimum. Indeed, strong capital buffers above the \nminimum requirement have proven to be critical, even in the absence of a cyclical minimum. \nFinally, the requirement to address excess credit growth is set at zero in normal times and \nonly increases during periods of excessive credit availability. However, even in the absence \nof a credit bubble, supervisors expect the banking sector to build a buffer above the minimum \nto protect it against plausibly severe shocks, which could emanate from many sources.  \n5. Addressing systemic risk and interconnectedness \n32.  While procyc licality\n amplified shocks over the time dimension, excessive \ninterconnectedness among systemically important banks also transmitted shocks across the \nfinancial system and economy. Systemically important banks should have loss absorbing \ncapacity beyond the minimum standards and the work on this issue is ongoing. The Basel \nCommittee and the Financial Stability Board are developing a well integrated approach to \nsystemically important financial institutions which could include combinations of capital \nsurcharges, contingent capital and bail-in debt. As part of this effort, the Committee is \ndeveloping a proposal on a methodology co mprising both quantitative and qualitative \nindicators to assess the systemic importance of financial institutions at a global level. The \nCommittee is also conducting a study of the magnitude of additional loss absorbency that \nglobally systemic financial institutions should have, along with an assessment of the extent of \ngoing concern loss absorbency which could be provided by the various proposed \ninstruments. The Committee’s analysis has also covered further measures to mitigate the \nrisks or externalities associated with systemic  banks, including liquidity surcharges, tighter \nlarge exposure restrictions and enhanced supervision.

Introducing a global  liquidity standard \n34. Strong capital requirements are a necessary condition for banking sector stability \nbut by themselves are not sufficient. A strong liquidity base reinforced through robust \nsupervisory standards is of equal impor tance. To date, however, there have been no \ninternationally harmonised standards in this area. The Basel Committee is therefore \nintroducing internationally harmonised global liquidity standards. As with the global capital \nstandards, the liquidity standards will establish minimum requirements and will promote an \ninternational level playing field to help prevent a competitive race to the bottom. \n35. During the early “liquidity phase” of the financial crisis, many banks – despite \nadequate capital levels – still experienced difficulties because they did not manage their \nliquidity in a prudent manner. The crisis again dr ove home the importance of liquidity to the \nproper functioning of financial markets and the banking sector. Prior to the crisis, asset \nmarkets were buoyant and funding was readily available at low cost. The rapid reversal in \nmarket conditions illustrated how quickly liquidity can evaporate and that illiquidity can last for \nan extended period of time. The banking system came under severe stress, which \nnecessitated central bank action to support both the functioning of money markets and, in \nsome cases, individual institutions. \n36. The difficulties experienced by some banks were due to lapses in basic principles of \nliquidity risk management. In re sponse, as the foundation of its liquidity framework, the \nCommittee in 2008 published Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and \nSupervision.\n7 The Sound Principles provide detailed guidance on the risk management and \nsupervision of funding liquidity risk and should help promote better risk management in this \ncritical area, but only if there is full impl ementation by banks and supervisors. As such, the \nCommittee will coordinate rigorous follow up by supervisors to ensure that banks adhere to \nthese fundamental principles.  \n37. To complement these principles, the Committee has further strengthened its liquidity \nframework by developing two minimum standards for funding liquidity. An additional \ncomponent of the liquidity framework is a set of monitoring metrics to improve cross-border \nsupervisory consistency.  \n38. These standards have been developed to ac hieve two separate but complementary \nobjectives. The first objective is to promote short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity risk \nprofile by ensuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute \nstress scenario lasting for one month. The Committee developed the Liquidity Coverage \nRatio (LCR) to achieve this objective. The seco nd objective is to promote resilience over a \n                                                \n \n7 Available at www.bis. org/publ/bcbs144.htm.", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 16}

The Net Stable Funding Ratio \n(NSFR) has a time horizon of one year and has been developed to provide a sustainable \nmaturity structure of assets and liabilities. \n39. These two standards are comprised mainly of specific parameters which are \ninternationally “harmonised” with prescribed values. Certain parameters contain elements of \nnational discretion to reflect jurisdiction-specific conditions. In these cases, the parameters \nshould be transparent and clearly outlined in the regulations of each jurisdiction to provide \nclarity both within the jurisdiction and internationally.  \n1. Liquidity Coverage Ratio  \n40. The LCR is intended to promote resilience to potential liqui dity disruptions over \na \nthirty day horizon. It will help ensure that global banks have sufficient unencumbered, high-\nquality liquid assets to offset the net cash outflows it could encounter under an acute short-\nterm stress scenario. The specified scenario is  built upon circumstances experienced in the \nglobal financial crisis that began in 2007 and entails both institution-specific and systemic \nshocks. The scenario entails a significant stress, albeit not a worst-case scenario, and \nassumes the following: \n a significant downgrade of the institution’s public credit rating;  \n a partial loss of deposits; \n a loss of unsecured wholesale funding; \n a significant increase in secured funding haircuts; and  \n increases in derivative collateral calls and substantial calls on contractual and non-\ncontractual off-balance sheet exposures, including committed credit and liquidity \nfacilities.  \n41. High-quality liquid assets held in the stock should be unencumbered, liquid in \nmarkets during a time of stress and, ideally, be central bank eligible. \n2. Net Stable Funding Ratio \n42. The NSFR requires a minimum am ount of st\nable sources of funding at a bank \nrelative to the liquidity profiles of the assets, as well as the potential for contingent liquidity \nneeds arising from off-balance sheet commitments, over a one-year horizon. The NSFR aims \nto limit over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding during times of buoyant market liquidity \nand encourage better assessment of liquidity risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items.  \n3. Monitoring tools \n43. At present, supervisors use a wide range of qu\nantitative measures to monitor the \nliquidity risk profiles of banking organisations as well as across the financial sector, for a \nmacroprudential approach to supervision. A survey of Basel Committee members conducted \nin early 2009 identified that more than 25 different measures and concepts are used globally \nby supervisors. To introduce more consistency internationally, the Committee has developed \na set of common metrics that should be considered as the minimum types of information \nwhich supervisors should use. In addition, supervisors may use additional metrics in order to \ncapture specific risks in their jurisdictions. The monitoring metrics include the following and", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 17}
{"text": "10 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\n \nmay evolve further as the Committee conducts further work. One area in particular where \nmore work on monitoring tools will be conducted relates to intraday liquidity risk.  \n(a) Contractual maturity mismatch: To gain an understanding of the basic aspects of a \nbank’s liquidity needs, banks should frequently conduct a contractual maturity mismatch \nassessment. This metric provides an initial, simple baseline of contractual commitments and \nis useful in comparing liquidity risk profiles across institutions, and to highlight to both banks \nand supervisors when potential liquidity needs could arise. \n(b) Concentration of funding: This metric involves analysing concentrations of wholesale \nfunding provided by specific counterparties, instruments and currencies. A metric covering \nconcentrations of wholesale funding assists supervisors in assessing the extent to which \nfunding liquidity risks could occur in the event that one or more of the funding sources are \nwithdrawn. \n(c) Available unencumbered assets: This metric measures the amount of \nunencumbered assets a bank has which could potentially be used as collateral for secured \nfunding either in the market or at standing central bank facilities. This should make banks \n(and supervisors) more aware of their potential capacity to raise additional secured funds, \nkeeping in mind that in a stressed situation this ability may decrease.  \n(d) LCR by currency: In recognition that foreign exchange risk is a component of \nliquidity risk, the LCR should also be assessed in each significant currency, in order to \nmonitor and manage the overall level and trend of currency exposure at a bank. \n(e) Market-related monitoring tools: In order to have a source of instantaneous data on \npotential liquidity difficulties, useful data to monitor includes market-wide data on asset prices \nand liquidity, institution-related information such as credit default swap (CDS) spreads and \nequity prices, and additional institution-specific information related to the ability of the \ninstitution to fund itself in various wholesale funding markets and the price at which it can do \nso.  \nC. Transitional arrangements \n44.  The Committee is introducing transitional arrangements to implement the new \nstandards that help ensure that the banking sector can meet the higher capital standards \nthrough reasonable earnings retention and capital raising, while still supporting lending to the \neconomy. The transitional arrangements are described in the Basel III liquidity rules text \ndocument and summarised in Annex 4 of this document.  \n45.  After an observation period beginning in 2011, the LCR will be introduced on \n1 January 2015. The NSFR will move to a minimum standard by 1 January 2018. The\n \nCommittee will put in place rigorous reporting processes to monitor the ratios during the \ntransition period and will continue to review the implications of these standards for financial \nmarkets, credit extension and economic gr owth, addressing unintended consequences as \nnecessary.  \n46.

The amount to be deducted from Tier 2 capital \nshould be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank’s \ncommon equity (as per above) multiplied by the Tier 2 capital holdings as a percentage of \nthe total capital holdings. \n82.  If, under the corresponding deduction approach, a bank is required to make a \ndeduction from a particular tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to \nsatisfy that deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from the next higher tier of capital (eg if a \nbank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will \nbe deducted from Common Equity Tier 1).   \n83.  Amounts below the threshold, which are not deducted, will continue to be risk \nweighted. Thus, instruments in the trading book will be treated as per the market risk rules \nand instruments in the banking book should be treated as per the internal ratings-based \napproach or the standardised approach (as applicable). For the application of risk weighting \nthe amount of the holdings must be allocated on a pro rata basis between those below and \nthose above the threshold. \nSignificant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are \noutside the scope of regulatory consolidation\n29  \n84.

Revised metric to better address counterparty credit risk, credit valuation \nadjustments and wrong-way risk \nEffective EPE with stressed parameters to address general wrong-way risk \n98. In order to implement these changes, a new paragraph 25(i) will be inserted in \nSection V (Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum requirements), Annex \n4, of the Basel II framework and the existing paragraph 61 of Annex 4\n will be revised as \nfollows for banks with permission to use the internal models method (IMM) to calculate \ncounterparty credit risk (CCR) regulatory capital – hereafter referred to as “IMM banks”: \n25(i). To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk as \ndefined in paragraph 105, banks must use the greater of the portfolio-level capital \ncharge (not including the CVA charge in paragraphs 97-104) based on Effective \nEPE using current market data and the portfolio-level capital charge based on \nEffective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress calibration should be a single \nconsistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of counterparties. The greater of \nEffective EPE using current market data and  the stress calibration should not be \napplied on a counterparty by counterparty basis, but on a total portfolio level.  \n61.

The \nfollowing process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration: \n The bank must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period \ncoincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads – such as \nloan or corporate bond spreads – for a representative selection of the \nbank’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the \nbank does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the \nbank should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on \nregion, internal rating and business types. \n The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or \nimplied, that include the data from the stressed credit period, and must use \nsuch data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration \nof the Effective EPE model to current data.  \n To evaluate the effectiveness of its st ress calibration for Effective EPE, the \nbank must create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the \nsame main risk factors to which the bank is exposed.

Treatment of mark-to-market counterparty risk losses (CVA capital \ncharge) \n- CVA Risk Capital Charge \n97. In addition to the default risk capital requirements for counterparty credit risk \ndetermined based on the standardised or internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches \nfor credit risk, a bank must add a capital charge to cover the risk of mark-to-market \nlosses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value \nadjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The CVA capital charge will be calculated in \nthe manner set forth below depending on the bank’s approved method of calculating \ncapital charges for counterparty credit risk and specific interest rate risk. A bank is \nnot required to include in this capital charge (i) transactions with a central \ncounterparty (CCP); and (ii) securities financing transactions (SFT), unless their \nsupervisor determines that the bank’s CVA loss exposures arising from SFT \ntransactions are material. \nA.

Banks with IMM approval for counterparty credit risk and approval to use the \nmarket risk internal models approach for the specific interest-rate risk of bonds must \ncalculate this additional capital charge by modelling the impact of changes in the \ncounterparties’ credit spreads on the CVAs of all OTC derivative counterparties, \ntogether with eligible CVA hedges according to new paragraphs 102 and 103, using \nthe bank’s VaR model for bonds. This VaR model is restricted to changes in the \ncounterparties’ credit spreads and does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes \nin other market factors, such as changes in the value of the reference asset, \ncommodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative.

Such \ntesting needs to address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when \nrelationships between risk factors have changed. Banks should monitor general \nwrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by other categories that are \ngermane to the business. Reports shoul d be provided to senior management and \nthe appropriate committee of the Board on a regular basis that communicate wrong \nway risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk. \nImplement an explicit Pillar 1 capital charge and revise Annex 4 where specific wrong-way \nrisk has been identified \n101. \nIn order to implement the requirement that the EAD calculation reflect a higher EAD \nvalue for counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified, paragraph 423 of \nthe Basel II text and paragraphs 29 and 58 of Annex 4 will be revised as follows: \n423. Each separate legal entity to which the bank is exposed must be separately \nrated. A bank must have policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding the \ntreatment of individual entities in a connected group including circumstances under \nwhich the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all related entities. \nThose policies must include a process for the identification of specific wrong way \nrisk for each legal entity to which th e bank is exposed. Transactions with \ncounterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified need to be treated \ndifferently when calculating the EAD for such exposures (see paragraph 58, Annex \n4). \n29. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as \nthe product of alpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for \ncounterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong way risk – \nsee paragraph 58): \n58. A bank is exposed to “specific wrong-way risk” if future exposure to a \nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of \ndefault. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong-\nway exposures for the buyer that is specific to the counterparty. A bank must have \nprocedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of specific wrong way risk, \nbeginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To \ncalculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal \nconnection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which \nspecific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same \nnetting set as other transactions with the counterparty.

Multiple-factor stress tests should, at a minimum, aim to address \nscenarios in which a) severe economic or market events have occurred; b) \nbroad market liquidity has decreased significantly; and c) the market impact \nof liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. These stress tests \nmay be part of bank-wide stress testing.   \n Stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty \nexposures, but also on the credit quality of counterparties. At least \nquarterly, banks should conduct stress testing applying stressed conditions \nto the joint movement of exposures and counterparty creditworthiness. \n Exposure stress testing (including single factor, multifactor and material \nnon-directional risks) and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness \nshould be performed at the counterparty-specific, counterparty group (eg \nindustry and region), and aggregate bank-wide CCR levels. \n Stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior \nmanagement. The analysis should capture the largest counterparty-level \nimpacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the \nportfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and \ncounterparty specific trends. \n The severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the \nstress test. When evaluating solvency under stress, factor shocks should \nbe severe enough to capture historical extreme market environments \nand/or extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The impact of \nsuch shocks on capital resources should be evaluated, as well as the \nimpact on capital requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day-to-day \nportfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations, banks \nshould also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability. \n Banks should consider reverse stress tests to identify extreme, but \nplausible, scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes. \n Senior management must take a lead role in the integration of stress \ntesting into the risk management framework and risk culture of the bank \nand ensure that the results are meaningful and proactively used to manage \ncounterparty credit risk. At a minimum, the results of stress testing for \nsignificant exposures should be compared to guidelines that express the \nbank’s risk appetite and elevated for discussion and action when excessive \nor concentrated risks are present.   \nModel validation and backtesting \n116.

The current Basel II requirements for backtesting will be replaced with the following: \n42. It is important that supervisory authorities are able to assure themselves \nthat banks using models have counterparty credit risk management systems that are \nconceptually sound and implemented with integrity. Accordingly the supervisory \nauthority will specify a number of qualitative criteria that banks would have to meet \nbefore they are permitted to use a models-based approach. The extent to which \nbanks meet the qualitative criteria may influence the level at which supervisory \nauthorities will set the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 32 (Alpha) above. \nOnly those banks in full compliance with the qualitative criteria will be eligible for \napplication of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria include: \n The bank must conduct a regular programme of backtesting, ie an ex-post \ncomparison of the risk measures\n45 generated by the model against realised \nrisk measures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static \npositions with realised measures. \n The bank must carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic \nreview of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The \nvalidation and review must be independent of the model developers.  \n The board of directors and senior management should be actively involved \nin the risk control process and must regard credit and counterparty credit \nrisk control as an essential aspect of the business to which significant \nresources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by \nthe independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of \nmanagement with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both \nreductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the \nbank’s overall risk exposure. \n The bank’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely \nintegrated into the day-to-day risk management process of the bank. Its \noutput should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, \nmonitoring and controlling the bank’s counterparty credit risk profile. \n The risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal \ntrading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be \nrelated to the bank’s risk measurement model in a manner that is \nconsistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit \nfunction and senior management. \n Banks should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a \ndocumented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning \nthe operation of the risk measurement system. The bank’s risk \nmeasurement system must be well documented, for example, through a \nrisk management manual that describes the basic principles of the risk \nmanagement system and that provides an explanation of the empirical \ntechniques used to measure counterparty credit risk.  \n An independent review of the risk measurement system should be carried \nout regularly in the bank’s own internal auditing process.

Banks must define how representative counterparty portfolios are \nconstructed for the purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures. \n46. When validating EPE models and its risk measures that produce forecast \ndistributions, validation must assess more than a single statistic of the model \ndistribution. \n46(i) As part of the initial and on-going validation of an IMM model and its risk \nmeasures, the following requirements must be met: \n A bank must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in \nmarket risk factors prior to supervisory approval. Backtesting must consider \na number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a \nrange of various start (initialisation) dates and covering a wide range of \nmarket conditions.  \n Banks must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model’s \nrelevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions that \nsupport EPE. For collateralised trades, the prediction time horizons \nconsidered must include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk \napplied in collateralised/margined trading, and must include long time \nhorizons of at least 1 year. \n The pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a \ngiven scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as \npart of the initial and on-going model validation process. These pricing \nmodels may be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a \nshort horizon. Pricing models for options must account for the nonlinearity \nof option value with respect to market risk factors. \n An EPE model must capture transaction specific information in order to \naggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. Banks must verify that \ntransactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model. \n Static, historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must \nbe a part of the validation process. At regular intervals as directed by its \nsupervisor, a bank must conduct such backtesting on a number of \nrepresentative counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must \nbe chosen based on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and \ncorrelations to which the bank is exposed. In addition, IMM banks need to \nconduct backtesting that is designed to test the key assumptions of the \nEPE model and the relevant risk measures, eg the modelled relationship \nbetween tenors of the same risk factor, and the modelled relationships \nbetween risk factors.  \n Significant differences between realised exposures and the forecast \ndistribution could indicate a problem with the model or the underlying data \nthat the supervisor would require the bank to correct. Under such \ncircumstances, supervisors may require additional capital to be held while \nthe problem is being solved.  \n The performance of EPE models and its risk measures must be subject to \ngood backtesting practice. The backtesting programme must be capable of \nidentifying poor performance in an EPE model’s risk measures.  \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 58}

Addressing reliance on external credit ratings and minimising cliff effects \n1. Standardised inferred rating treatment for long-term exposures  \n118. Para. 99 of the Basel II text would be modified as follows:  \n99. Where a bank invests in a particular issue that has an  issue-spe\ncific \nassessment, the risk weight of the claim will be based on this assessment. Where \nthe bank’s claim is not an investment in a specific assessed issue, the following \ngeneral principles apply. \n In circumstances where the borrower has a specific assessment for an \nissued debt – but the bank’s claim is not an investment in this particular \ndebt – a high quality credit assessment (one which maps into a risk weight \nlower than that which applies to an unrated claim) on that specific debt may \nonly be applied to the bank’s unassessed claim if this claim ranks pari \npassu or senior to the claim with an assessment in all respects. If not, the \ncredit assessment cannot be used and the unassessed claim will receive \nthe risk weight for unrated claims. \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 59}
{"text": "52 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\n \n In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer assessment, this \nassessment typically applies to senior unsecured claims on that issuer. \nConsequently, only senior claims on that issuer will benefit from a high \nquality issuer assessment. Other unassessed claims of a highly assessed \nissuer will be treated as unrated. If eit her the issuer or a single issue has a \nlow quality assessment (mapping into a risk weight equal to or higher than \nthat which applies to unrated claims), an unassessed claim on the same \ncounterparty that ranks pari passu or is subordinated to either the senior \nunsecured issuer assessment or the exposure assessment will be assigned \nthe same risk weight as is applicable to the low quality assessment. \n2. Incentive to avoid getting exposures rated \n119. Para. 733 of the Basel II text will read as follows:  \n733. Credit risk: Banks should have met\nhodologies that enable them to assess \nthe credit risk involved in exposures to individual borrowers or counterparties as well \nas at the portfolio level. Banks should assess exposures, regardless of whether they \nare rated or unrated, and determine whether the risk weights applied to such \nexposures, under the Standardised Approach, are appropriate for their inherent risk. \nIn those instances where a bank determines that the inherent risk of such an \nexposure, particularly if it is unrated, is significantly higher than that implied by the \nrisk weight to which it is assigned, the bank should consider the higher degree of \ncredit risk in the evaluation of its overall capital adequacy. For more sophisticated \nbanks, the credit review assessment of capital adequacy, at a minimum, should \ncover four areas: risk rating systems, portfolio analysis/aggregation, \nsecuritisation/complex credit derivatives, and large exposures and risk \nconcentrations.  \n3. Incorporation of IOSCO’s Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating \nAgencies \n120. Paragraph 91 and 565(b) of the Basel II text will read as follows (paragraph 90 does \nnot need additional changes):  \n1.  The recognition process \n90.  National supervisors are responsible for determining on  a continuous b\nasis \nwhether an external credit assessment instit ution (ECAI) meets the criteria listed in \nthe paragraph below. National supervisors should refer to the IOSCO Code of \nConduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies when determining ECAI \neligibility. The assessments of ECAIs may be recognised on a limited basis, e.g. by \ntype of claims or by jurisdiction. The supervisory process for recognising ECAIs \nshould be made public to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry. \n2.  Eligibility criteria \n91.  An ECAI must satisfy each of the following six criteria.  \n Objectivity: no change suggested  \n Independence: no chan\nge suggested \n International access/Transparency: The individual assessments,  the key \nelements underlining the assessments and whether the issuer participated \nin the assessment process should be publicly available on a non-selective \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 60}

In addition, the general \nprocedures, methodologies and assumptions for arriving at assessments \nused by the ECAI should be publicly available. \n Disclosure: An ECAI should disclose the following information: its code of \nconduct; the general nature of its compensation arrangements with \nassessed entities; its assessment methodologies, including the definition of \ndefault, the time horizon, and the meaning of each rating; the actual default \nrates experienced in each assessment category; and the transitions of the \nassessments, e.g. the likelihood of AA ratings becoming A over time. \n Resources: no change suggested \n Credibility: no change suggested \n3.  Operational requirements for use of external credit assessments \n565.  The following operational criteria concerning the use of \nexternal credit \nassessments apply in the standardised and IRB approaches of the securitisation \nframework: \n(a) no change  \n(b) The external credit assessments must be from an eligible ECAI as \nrecognised by the bank’s national supervisor in accordance with paragraphs 90 to \n108 with the following exception. In contrast with bullet three of paragraph 91, an \neligible credit assessment, procedures, methodologies, assumptions, and the key \nelements underlining the assessments must be publicly available, on a non-selective \nbasis and free of charge.\n46 In other words, a rating must be published in an \naccessible form and included in the ECAI’s transition matrix. Also, loss and cash-\nflow analysis as well as sensitivity of ratings to changes in the underlying ratings \nassumptions should be publicly available. Consequently, ratings that are made \navailable only to the parties to a transaction do not satisfy this requirement. \n(c) to (f) no change  \n4. “Cliff effects” arising from guarantees and credit derivatives - Credit risk \nmitigation (CRM) \nStandardised Approach - Range of eligible guarantors (counter-guarantors)/protection \nproviders \n195.  Credit protection given by the following entities will be recog nised: \n \nsovereign entities, PSEs, banks, and securities firms with a lower risk \nweight than the counterparty.  \n other entities that are externally rated except when credit protection is \nprovided to a securitisation exposure. This would include credit protection \nprovided by parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies when they have a \nlower risk weight than the obligor. \n                                                \n \n46  Where the eligible credit assessment is not provid ed free of charge the ECAI should provide an adequate \njustification, within their own publicly available Code of  Conduct, in accordance with the 'comply or explain' \nnature of the IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies. \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 61}

For banks using the foundation approach f or LGD, th\ne approach to \nguarantees and credit derivatives closel y follows the treatment under the \nstandardised approach as specified in paragraphs 189 to 201. The range of eligible \nguarantors is the same as under the standardised approach except that companies \nthat are internally rated may also be recognised under the foundation approach. To \nreceive recognition, the requirements outlined in paragraphs 189 to 194 must be \nmet.  \n5. Unsolicited ratings and recognition of ECAIs \n121. Paragraph 94 and 108 of the Basel II text will be modified as follows:  \n94. Banks must use the ch\nosen ECAIs and their ratings consistently for each \ntype of claim, for both risk weighting and risk management purposes. Banks will not \nbe allowed to “cherry-pick” the assessm ents provided by different ECAIs and to \narbitrarily change the use of ECAIs. \n108. As a general rule, banks should use solicited ratings from eligible ECAIs. \nNational supervisory authorities may, however, allow banks to use unsolicited \nratings in the same way as solicited ratings if they are satisfied that the credit \nassessments of unsolicited ratings are not inferior in quality to the general quality of \nsolicited ratings. However, there may be the potential for ECAIs to use unsolicited \nratings to put pressure on entities to obtain solicited ratings. Such behaviour, when \nidentified, should cause supervisors to consider whether to continue recognising \nsuch ECAIs as eligible for capital adequacy purposes. \nIII. Capital conservation buffer \n122. This section outlines the operation of the capital conservation buffer, which is \ndesigned to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress which can be \ndrawn down as losses are incurred. The requirement is based on simple capital conservation \nrules designed to avoid breaches of minimum capital requirements. \nA. Capital conservation best practice \n123. Outside of periods of stress,  ban\nks should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum.  \n124. When buffers have been drawn down, one way banks should look to rebuild them is \nthrough reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include reducing dividend \npayments, share-backs and staff bonus payments. Banks may also choose to raise new \ncapital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 62}
{"text": "Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 55\n \n \nThe balance between these options should be discussed with supervisors as part of the \ncapital planning process. \n125. It is clear that greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have \nbeen depleted. Therefore, in the absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of \nearnings retained by banks for the purpose of rebuilding their capital buffers should increase \nthe nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirement.  \n126. It is not acceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, \nother capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must \nbear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. \n127. It is also not acceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to try \nand use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. Not only is this \nirresponsible from the perspective of an individual bank, putting shareholders interests above \ndepositors, it may also encourage other banks to follow suit. As a consequence, banks in \naggregate can end up increasing distributions at the exact point in time when they should be \nconserving earnings. \n128. The framework reduces the discretion of banks which have depleted their capital \nbuffers to further reduce them through generous distributions of earnings. In doing so, the \nframework will strengthen their ability to wi thstand adverse environments. Implementation of \nthe framework through internationally agreed c apital conservation rules will help increase \nsector resilience both going into a downturn, and provide the mechanism for rebuilding \ncapital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of \nearnings during a downturn will help ensure that capital remains available to support the \nongoing business operations of banks through the period of stress. In this way the framework \nshould help reduce procyclicality.  \nB. The framework  \n129. A capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1, i s\n \nestablished above the regulatory minimum capital requirement. 47 Capital distribution \nconstraints will be imposed on a bank when capital levels fall within this range. Banks will be \nable to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall into the conservation range \nas they experience losses.

The distribution constraints imposed on banks when their capital levels fall into the \nrange increase as the banks’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, \nthe constraints imposed on banks with capital levels at the top of the range would be \nminimal. This reflects an expectation that banks’ capital levels will from time to time fall into \nthis range.

The table below shows the minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at \nvarious levels of the Common Equity Tier 1 (CE T1) capital ratios. For example, a bank with a \nCET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% is required to conserve 80% of its \nearnings in the subsequent financial year (ie payout no more than 20% in terms of dividends, \nshare buybacks and discretionary bonus payments). If the bank wants to make payments in \nexcess of the constraints imposed by this regime, it would have the option of raising capital in \nthe private sector equal to the amount above the constraint which it wishes to distribute. This \nwould be discussed with the bank’s supervisor as part of the capital planning process. The \nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% minimum Common \nEquity Tier 1 requirement, but excludes any additional Common Equity Tier 1 needed to \nmeet the 6% Tier 1 and 8% Total Capital requirements.

Introduction  \n136.  Losses incurred in the banking sector can be extremely large when a downturn is \npreceded by a period of excess credit growth. These losses can destabilise the banking \nsector and spark a vicious circle, whereby probl ems in the financial system can contribute to \na downturn in the real economy that then feeds back on to the banking sector. These \ninteractions highlight the particular importance of the banking sector building up additional \ncapital defences in periods where the risks of system-wide stress are growing markedly.  \n137.  The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements \ntake account of the macro-financial environment in which banks operate. It will be deployed \nby national jurisdictions when excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with \na build-up of system-wide risk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect \nit against future potential losses. This focus on excess aggregate credit growth means that \njurisdictions are likely to only need to deploy the buffer on an infrequent basis. The buffer for \ninternationally-active banks will be a weighted average of the buffers deployed across all the \njurisdictions to which it has credit exposures. This means that they will likely find themselves \nsubject to a small buffer on a more frequent basis, since credit cycles are not always highly \ncorrelated across jurisdictions.  \n138.  The countercyclical buffer regime consists of the following elements: \n(a) National authorities will monitor credit growth and other indicators that may signal a \nbuild up of system-wide risk and make asse ssments of whether credit growth is \nexcessive and is leading to the build up of system-wide risk.

Bank specific countercyclical buffer \n142.

{"text": "Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 61\n \n \nV. Leverage ratio \nA. Rationale and objective \n151.  One of the underlying features of the crisis was the build-up of excessive on- and \noff-balance sheet leverage in the banking system . In many cases, banks built up excessive \nleverage while still showing strong risk based capital ratios. During the most severe part of \nthe crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner \nthat amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating the positive feedback \nloop between losses, declines in bank capital, and contraction in credit availability. \n152.  Therefore, the Committee agreed to introduce a simple, transparent, non-risk based \nleverage ratio that is calibrated to act as a cr edible supplementary measure to the risk based \ncapital requirements. The leverage ratio is intended to achieve the following objectives: \n constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilising \ndeleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the \neconomy; and \n reinforce the risk based requirements with a simple, non-risk based “backstop” \nmeasure. \nB. Definition and calculation of the leverage ratio \n153.  This section presents the definitio n and calculation of\n the leverage ratio, which \nwould serve as the basis for testing during the parallel run period. The basis of calculation is \nthe average of the monthly leverage ratio over the quarter based on the definitions of capital \n(the capital measure) and total exposure (the exposure measure) specified in paragraphs \n154 to 164. The Committee will test a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3% during the parallel \nrun period from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017. Additional transitional arrangements are \nset out in paragraphs 165 to 167.   \n1.  Capital measure \n154.  The capital measure for the leverage ratio should be based on the new definition \nof \nTier 1 capital as set out in paragraphs 52 to 56 of this Framework. The Committee also will \ncollect data during the transition period to track the impact of using total regulatory capital \nand Common Equity Tier 1.  \n155.  Items that are deducted completely from capital do not contribute to leverage, and \nshould therefore also be deducted from the measure of exposure. That is, the capital and \nexposure should be measured consistently and  should avoid double counting. This means \nthat deductions from Tier 1 capital (as set out  in paragraphs 66 to 89) should also be made \nfrom the exposure measure. \n156.  According to the treatment outlined in paragraphs 84 to 89, where a financial entity \nis included in the accounting consolidation but not in the regulatory consolidation, the \ninvestments in the capital of these entities are required to be deducted to the extent that that \nthey exceed certain thresholds. To ensure that the capital and exposure are measured \nconsistently for the purposes of the leverage ratio, the assets of such entities included in the \naccounting consolidation should be excluded from  the exposure measure in proportion to the \ncapital that is excluded under paragraphs 84 to 89. \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 69}
{"text": "62 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\n \n2.  Exposure measure \n(i)  General measurement principles \n157.  The exposure measure for the leverage ratio sh\nould generally follow the accounting \nmeasure of exposure. To be measured consistently with financial accounts, the following \nshould apply:  \n on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures are net of specific provisions and \nvaluation adjustments (eg credit valuation adjustments); \n physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased is not \nallowed to reduce on-balance sheet exposures; and \n netting of loans and deposits is not allowed. \n(ii)  On-balance sheet items \n158.  Banks should include item s using th\neir accounting balance sheet for the purposes of \nthe leverage ratio. In addition, the exposure measure should include the following treatments \nfor Securities Financing Transactions (SFT)54 and derivatives. \n(a)  Repurchase agreements and securities finance \n159.  SFT are a form of secured funding and therefor e an important source \nof balance \nsheet leverage that should be included in the leverage ratio. Therefore, banks should \ncalculate SFT for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:  \n the accounting measure of exposure; and \n the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework. 55  \n(b)  Derivatives \n160.  Derivatives create two types of exposure: an “on-balance sheet” present value \nreflecting th\ne fair value of the contract (often zero at outset but subsequently positive or \nnegative depending on the performance of the contract), and a notional economic exposure \nrepresenting the underlying economic interest of the contract. \n161.  Banks should calculate derivatives, including where a bank sells protection using a \ncredit derivative, for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:  \n the accounting measure of exposure plus an add-on for potential future exposure \ncalculated according to the Current Exposure Method as identified in paragraphs \n186, 187 and 317 of the Basel II Framework. This ensures that all derivatives are \nconverted in a consistent manner to a “loan equivalent” amount; and \n the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework. 56 \n                                                 \n54  Securities Financing Transactions are transactio ns such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase \nagreements, security lending and borrowing, and marg in lending transactions, where the value of the \ntransactions depends on the market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements. \n55   Excepting the rules for cross-product netting in Annex 4, section 3. \n56   Excepting the rules for cross-product netting in Annex 4, section 3. \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm", "source": "bcbs189.pdf", "page": 70}

This section relates to off-balance sheet (OBS) items in paragraphs 82-83, \n(including 83(i)), 84(i-iii), 85-86, and 88-89) of the Basel II Framework. These include \ncommitments (including liquidity facilities), unconditionally cancellable commitments, direct \ncredit substitutes, acceptances, standby letters of credit, trade letters of credit, failed \ntransactions and unsettled securities. The treatment of the items included in 83(ii) and 84, ie \nrepurchase agreements and securities financing transactions is addressed above. \n163.  The Committee recognises that OBS items are a source of potentially significant \nleverage. Therefore, banks should calculate the above OBS items for the purposes of the \nleverage ratio by applying a uniform 100% credit conversion factor (CCF).  \n164. For any commitments that are unconditionally  cancellable at any time by the bank \nwithout prior notice, banks should apply a CCF of 10%. The Committee will conduct further \nreview to ensure that the 10% CCF is appropriately conservative based on historical \nexperience.  \nC. Transitional arrangements \n165. The transition period for the leverage ratio will commence 1 January 2011. The \nCommittee will use  the\n transition period to monitor banks’ leverage data on a semi-annual \nbasis in order to assess whether the proposed design and calibration of the minimum Tier 1 \nleverage ratio of 3% is appropriate over a full credit cycle and for different types of business \nmodels. This assessment will include consid eration of whether a wider definition of \nexposures and an offsetting adjustment in the ca libration would better achieve the objectives \nof the leverage ratio.

{"text": "Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms 1 \n \n \nIntroduction \n1. This document sets out the Basel Committee’s finalisation of the Basel III framework. It \ncomplements the initial phase of Basel III reforms previously finalised by the Committee. The Basel III \nframework is a central element of the Basel Committee’s response to the global financial crisis. It addresses \na number of shortcomings with the pre-crisis regulatory framework and provides a regulatory foundation \nfor a resilient banking system that supports the real economy. \n2. A key objective of the revisions in this document is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted \nassets (RWAs).  At the peak of the global financial crises, a wide range of stakeholders – including \nacademics, analysts and market participants – lost faith in banks’ reported risk-weighted capital ratios. The \nCommittee’s own empirical analyses highlighted a worrying degree of variability in the calculation of RWAs \nby banks.  \n3. A prudent and credible calculation of RWAs is an integral element of the risk -weighted capital \nframework. Banks’ reported risk-weighted capital ratios should be sufficiently transparent and comparable \nto permit stakeholders to assess their risk profile.  The Committee’s strategic review of the regulatory \nframework highlighted a number of fault lines with the existing architecture, particularly the extent to \nwhich it adequately balances simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity.  \n4. The revisions to the regulatory framework set out in this document will help restore credibility in \nthe calculation of RWAs by: (i) enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardised \napproaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital \nratios; (ii) constraining the use of internally -modelled approaches; and (iii) complementing the risk -\nweighted capital ratio with a finalised leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. An \naccompanying document summarises the main features of these revisions.\n1  \n5. In finalising these reforms, the Committee was guided by three overarching principles. First, the \nCommittee is firmly committed to its mandate of strengthening the regulation, supervision and practices \nof banks worldwide, with the purpose of enhancing financial stability . A banking system that is resilient \nwill be able to support the real economy and contribute positively to sustainable economic growth over \nthe medium term. \n6. Second, the Committee actively seeks the views of stakeholders when developing standards. For \nthese reforms, the Committee conducted an extensive consultation process with a wide range of \nstakeholders. The Committee thanks all stakeholders for their constructive contributions during this \nprocess. \n7. Third, the Committee conducted a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the impact of \nthese revisions on the banking system and the wider macro  economy. As a result of this assessment, the \nCommittee focused on not significantly increasing overall capital requirements.\n2 This is reflected in the \ndesign, calibrat ion and transitional arrangements discussed below. The Committee will continue to \nmonitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these reforms in reducing excessive RWA variability.  \n8. While the revised framework will continue to permit the use of internally -modelled approaches \nfor certain risk categories (subject to supervisory approval), a jurisdiction which does not implement some \nor all of the internal- modelled approaches but instead only implements the standardised approaches is \ncompliant with the Basel  framework. More generally, jurisdictions may elect to implement", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 5}

{"text": "Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms 3 \n \n \nStandardised approach for credit risk \nIntroduction \n1. The Committee permits banks to choose between two broad methodologies for calculating their \nrisk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first, the standardised approach, assigns standardised \nrisk weights to exposures as described in paragraphs 4 to 97.  To determine  the risk weights in the \nstandardised approach for certain exposure classes, in jurisdictions that allow the use of external ratings \nfor regulatory purposes, banks may, as a starting point, use assessments by external  credit assessment \ninstitutions that are recognised as eligible for capital purposes by national supervisors, in accordance with \nparagraphs 98 to 116. Under the standardised approach, exposures should be risk-weighted net of specific \nprovisions (including partial write-offs). \n2. The second risk-weighted capital treatment for measuring credit risk, the internal ratings-based \n(IRB) approach, allows banks to use their internal rating systems for credit risk, subject to the explicit \napproval of the bank’s supervisor. \n3. Securitisation exposures are addressed in the securitisation standard.\n1 Credit equivalent amounts \nof OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives and long -settlement transactions that expose a bank to \ncounterparty credit risk 2  are to be calc ulated under the counterparty credit risk standards . 3  Equity \ninvestments in funds and exposures to central counterparties must be treated according to their own \nspecific frameworks.\n4  \n \n1  The securitisation standard is available at www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d374.pdf. \n2  Counterparty credit risk is defined as the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before the final settlement of \nthe transaction’s cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty \nhas a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike a firm’s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure \nto credit risk is unilateral and only the lending bank faces the risk of loss, counterparty credit risk creates a bilateral risk of loss: \nthe market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value i s \nuncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors. \n3  The counterparty credit risk standards are set out in Annex 4 of the Basel II framework (June 2006), amended to reflect the \nchanges set out in: (i) Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems (June 2011), available \nat www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf; (ii) The standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (April 2014), \navailable at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs279.pdf; and (iii) Capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties (April \n2014), available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs282.pdf. \n4  Standards on capital requirements for banks’ equity investments in funds are available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs266.pdf; and \nfor capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties are set ou t in Section XI of the counterparty credit risk \nstandards.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 7}

Consistent with the Committee’s guidance on the assessment of credit risk 5 and paragraphs 733 \nto 735 of the Basel II framework (June 2006), banks must perform due diligence to ensure that they have \nan adequate understanding, at origination and thereafter on a regular basis (at least annually), of the risk \nprofile and characteristics of their counterparties. In cases where ratings are used, due diligence is \nnecessary to assess the risk of the exposure for risk management purposes and whether the risk weight \napplied is appropriate and prudent.\n6 The sophistication of the due diligence should be appropriate to the \nsize and complexity of banks’ activities. Banks must take reasonable and adequate steps to assess the \noperating and financial performance levels and trends through inte rnal credit analysis and/or other \nanalytics outsourced to a third party, as appropriate for each counterparty. Banks must be able to access \ninformation about their counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses.  \n5. For exposures to entities belonging to consolidated groups, due diligence should, to the extent \npossible, be performed at the solo entity level to which there is a credit exposure. In evaluating the \nrepayment capacity of the solo entity, banks are expected to take into acco unt the support of the group \nand the potential for it to be adversely impacted by problems in the group. \n6. Banks should have in place effective internal policies, processes, systems and controls to ensure \nthat the appropriate risk weights are assigned to counterparties. Banks must be able to demonstrate to \ntheir supervisors that their due diligence analyses are appropriate. As part of their supervisory review, \nsupervisors should ensure that banks have appropriately performed their due diligence analyses, and \nshould take supervisory measures where these have not been done. \n1.  Exposures to sovereigns  \n(Treatment unchanged from the Basel II framework (June 2006)) \n7.  Exposures to sovereigns and their central banks will be risk-weighted as follows: \nRisk weight table for sovereigns and central banks Table 1 \nExternal rating AAA to AA– A+ to A– BBB+ to BBB– BB+ to B– Below B– Unrated \nRisk weight 0% 20% 50% 100% 150% 100% \n \n \n5  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses , December 2015, \navailable at www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d350.pdf. \n6  The due diligence requirements do not apply to the exposures set out in paragraphs 7 to 12.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 8}

At national discretion, a lower risk weight may be applied to banks’ exposures to their sovereign \n(or central bank) of incorporation denominated in domestic currency and funded7 in that currency.8 Where \nthis discretion is exercised, other national supervisors may also permit their banks to apply the same risk \nweight to domestic currency exposures to this sovereign (or central bank) funded in that currency.  \n9. For the purpose of risk -weighting exposures to sovereigns, supervisors may recognise the \ncountry risk scores assigned by Export Credit Agencies (ECAs). To qualify, an ECA must publish its risk \nscores and subscribe to the OECD -agreed methodology. Banks may choose to use the risk scores \npublished by individual ECAs that are recognised by their supervisor, or the consensus risk scores of ECAs \nparticipating in the “Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits”. 9  The OECD -agreed \nmethodology establishes eight risk score categories associated with minimum export insurance premiums. \nThese ECA risk scores will correspond to risk weight categories as detailed below. \nRisk weight table for sovereigns and central banks Table 2 \nECA risk scores 0 to 1 2 3 4 to 6 7 \nRisk weight 0% 20% 50% 100% 150% \n \n10.

If the activity is related to real estate, the \ntreatment would be determined in accordance with paragraphs 59 to 75; \n• The exposure is typically to an entity (often a special purpose vehicle (SPV)) that was created \nspecifically to finance and/or operate physical assets; \n• The borrowing entity has few or no other material assets or activities, and therefore little or no \nindependent capacity to repay the obligation, apart from the income that it receiv es from the \nasset(s) being financed . T he primary source of repayment of the obligation is the income \ngenerated by the asset(s), rather than the independent capacity of the borrowing entity; and \n• The terms of the obligation give the lender a substantial degree of control over the asset(s) and \nthe income that it generates. \n45.

This type of financing is usually for large, complex and expensive installations such as power \nplants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, media, and \ntelecoms. Project finance may take the form of financing the construction of a new capital \ninstallation, or refinancing of an existing installation, with or without improvements.  \n(ii) Object finance refers to the method of funding the acquisition of equipment (eg ships, aircraft, \nsatellites, railcars, and fleets) where the repayment of the loan is dependent on the cash flows \ngenerated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. \n(iii) Commodities finance refers to short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables \nof exchange-traded commodities (eg crude oil, metals, or crops), where the loan will be repaid \nfrom the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity \nto repay the loan. \n46.

Moreover, external ratings \nmust be subject to ongoing review and responsive to changes in financial condition. Before being \nrecognised by supervisors, a rating methodology for each market segment, including rigorous \nbacktesting, must have been established for at least one year and preferably three years. \n• Independence: An ECAI should be independent and should not be subject to political or \neconomic pressures that may influence the rating. In particular, an ECAI should not delay or \nrefrain from taking a rating action based on its potential effect (economic, political or otherwise). \nThe rating process should be as free as possible from any constraints that could arise in situations \nwhere the composition of the board of directors or the shareholder structure of the CRA may be \nseen as creating a conflict of interest. Furthermore, an ECAI should separate operationally, legally \nand, if practicable, physically its rating business from other businesses and analysts. \n• International access/transparency : The individual ratings, the key elements underlining the \nassessments and whether the issuer participated in the rating process should be publicly available \non a non-selective basis, unless they are private ratings, which should be at least available to both \ndomestic and foreign insitutions with legitimate interest and on equivalent terms. In addition, the \nECAI’s general procedures, methodologies and assumptions for arriving at ratings should be \npublicly available. \n• Disclosure: An ECAI should disclose the following information: its code of conduct; the general \nnature of its compensation arrangements with assessed entities; any conflict of interest,\n60 the \nECAI's compensation arrangements, 61 its assessment methodologies, including the definition of \ndefault, the time horizon, and the meaning of each rating; the actual default rates experienced in \neach assessment category; and the transitions of the ratings, eg the likelihood of AA ratings \nbecoming A over time.

{"text": "30 Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms \n \n \nWhen disclosing a rating, the information should be provided in plain language, indicating the \nnature and limitation of credit ratings and the risk of unduly relying on them to make investments. \n• Resources: An ECAI should have sufficient resources to carry out high-quality credit assessments. \nThese resources should allow for substantial ongoing contact with senior and operational levels \nwithin the entities assessed in order to add value to the credit assessments. In particular, ECAIs \nshould assign analysts with appropriate knowledge and experience to assess the creditworthiness \nof the type of entity or obligation being rated. Such assessments should be based on \nmethodologies combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. \n• Credibility: To some extent, credibility is derived from the criteria above. In addition, the reliance \non an ECAI’s external ratings by independent parties (investors, insurers, trading partners) is \nevidence of the credibility of the ratings of an ECAI. The credibility of an ECAI is also underpinned \nby the existence of internal procedures to prevent the misuse of confidential information. In order \nto be eligible for recognition, an ECAI does not have to assess firms in more than one country.  \n• No abuse of unsolicited ratings : ECAIs mus t not use unsolicited ratings to put pressure on \nentities to obtain solicited ratings. Supervisors should consider whether to continue recognising \nsuch ECAIs as eligible for capital adequacy purposes, if such behaviour is identified.  \n• Cooperation with the s upervisor: ECAIs should notify the supervisor of significant changes to \nmethodologies and provide access to external ratings and other relevant data in order to support \nintial and continued determination of eligibility. \nC. Implementation considerations in jurisdictions that allow use of \nexternal ratings for regulatory purposes \n1. The mapping process \n100. Supervisors will be responsible for assigning eligible ECAIs’ ratings to the risk weights available \nunder the standardised risk weighting framework, ie deciding which rating categories correspond to which \nrisk weights. The mapping process should be objective and should result in a risk weight assignment \nconsistent with that of the level of credit risk reflected in the tables above. It should cover the full spectrum \nof risk weights. \n101. When conducting such a mapping process, factors that supervisors should assess include, among \nothers, the size and scope of the pool of issuers that each ECAI covers, the range and meaning of the \nratings that it assigns, and the definition of default used by the ECAI.  \n102. In order to promote a more consistent mapping of ratings into the available risk weights and \nhelp supervisors in conducting such a process, Annex 2 of the Basel II framework (June 2006) provides \nguidance as to how such a mapping process may be conducted. \n103. Banks must use the chosen ECAIs and their ratings consistently for all types of claim where they \nhave been recognised by their supervisor as an eligible ECAI, for both risk-weighting and risk management \npurposes. Banks will not be allowed to “cherry -pick” the ratings provided by different ECAIs and to \narbitrarily change the use of ECAIs.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 34}
{"text": "Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms 31 \n \n \n2. Multiple external ratings \n104. If there is only one rating by an ECAI chosen by a bank for a particular claim, that  rating should \nbe used to determine the risk weight of the exposure. \n105. If there are two ratings by ECAIs chosen by a bank that map into different risk weights, the higher \nrisk weight will be applied. \n106. If there are three or more ratings with differen t risk weights, the two ratings that correspond to \nthe lowest risk weights should be referred to. If these give rise to the same risk weight, that risk weight \nshould be applied. If different, the higher risk weight should be applied.  \n3. Determination of whether an exposure is rated: Issue-specific and issuer ratings \n107. Where a bank invests in a particular issue that has an issue- specific rating, the risk weight of the \nexposure will be based on this rating. Where the bank’s exposure is not an investment in a specific rated \nissue, the following general principles apply. \n• In circumstances where the borrower has a specific rating for an issued debt – but the bank’s \nexposure is not an investment in this particular debt – a high-quality credit rating  (one which \nmaps into a risk weight lower than that which applies to an unrated claim) on that specific debt \nmay only be applied to the bank’s unrated exposure if this claim ranks in all respects pari passu \nor senior to the claim with a rating. If not, the external rating cannot be used and the unassessed \nclaim will receive the risk weight for unrated exposures. \n• In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer rating, this rating typically applies to senior \nunsecured claims on that issuer. Consequently, only senior claims on that issuer will benefit from \na high-quality issuer rating. Other unassessed exposures of a highly rated issuer will be treated \nas unrated. If either the issuer or a single issue has a low-quality rating (mapping into a risk weight \nequal to or higher than that which applies to unrated exposures), an unassessed exposure to the \nsame counterparty that ranks pari passu or is subordinated to either the senior unsecured issuer \nrating or the exposure with a low -quality rating will be assigned the same ri sk weight as is \napplicable to the low-quality assessment. \n• In circumstances where the issuer has a specific high-quality rating (one which maps into a lower \nrisk weight) that only applies to a limited class of liabilities (such as a deposit assessment or a \ncounterparty risk assessment), this may only be used in respect of exposures that fall within that \nclass. \n108. Whether the bank intends to rely on an issuer - or an issue-specific rating, the rating must take \ninto account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to all payments \nowed to it.\n62  \n \n62  For example, if a bank is owed both principal and interest, the assessment must fully take into account and reflect the credi t \nrisk associated with repayment of both principal and interest.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 35}

In order to avoid any double-counting of credit enhancement factors, no supervisory recognition \nof credit risk mitigation techniques will be taken into account if the credit enhancement is already reflected \nin the issue specific rating (see paragraph 121). \n4. Domestic currency and foreign currency ratings \n110. Where exposures are risk -weighted based on the rating of an equivalent exposure to that \nborrower, the general rule is that foreign currency ratings would be used for exposures in foreign currency. \nDomestic currency ratings, if separate, would only  be used to risk-weight exposures denominated in the \ndomestic currency.\n63 \n5. Short-term/long-term ratings \n111. For risk-weighting purposes, short -term ratings are deemed to be issue -specific. They can only \nbe used to derive risk weights for exposures arising from the rated facility. They cannot be generalised to \nother short-term exposures, except under the conditions of paragraph 113. In no event can a short -term \nrating be used to support a risk weight for an unrated long -term exposure. Short-term ratings may only \nbe used for short- term exposures against banks and corporates. The table below provides a framework \nfor banks’ exposures to specific short-term facilities, such as a particular issuance of commercial paper: \nRisk weight table for specific short-term ratings Table 15 \nExternal rating A-1/P-164 A-2/P-2 A-3/P-3 Others65 \nRisk weight 20% 50% 100% 150% \n \n112. If a short -term rated facility attracts a 50% risk- weight, unrated short -term exposures cannot \nattract a risk weight lower than 100%. If an issuer has a short -term facility with an external rating that \nwarrants a risk weight of 150%, all unrated exposures,  whether long -term or short -term, should also \nreceive a 150% risk weight, unless the bank uses recognised credit risk mitigation techniques for such \nexposures.  \n113. In cases where short -term ratings are available, the following interaction with the genera l \npreferential treatment for short-term exposures to banks as described in paragraph 19 will apply: \n• The general preferential treatment for short-term exposures applies to all exposures to banks of \nup to three months original maturity when there is no specific short-term claim assessment. \n• When there is a short -term rating and such a rating maps into a risk weight that is more \nfavourable (ie lower) or identical to that derived from the general preferential treatment, the \nshort-term rating should be used for the specific exposure only. Other short -term exposures \nwould benefit from the general preferential treatment. \n \n63  H owever, when an exposure arises through a bank’s participation in a loan that has been extended, or has been guaranteed \nagainst convertibility and transfer risk, by certain MDBs, its convertibility and transfer risk can be considered by national  \nsupervisors to be effectively mitigated. To qualify, MDBs must have preferred creditor status recognised in the market and be \nincluded in footnote 11 (in paragraph 14).

Use of unsolicited ratings \n116. As a general rule, banks should use solicited ratings from eligible ECAIs. National supervisors may \nallow banks to use unsolicited ratings in the same way as solicited ratings if they are satisfied that the credit \nassessments of unsolicited ratings are not inferior in quality to the general quality of solicited ratings.  \nD. Credit risk mitigation techniques for exposures risk-weighted under \nthe standardised approach \n1. Overarching issues \n(i) Introduction \n117. Banks use a number of techniques to mitigate the credit risks to which they are exposed. For \nexample, exposures may be collateralised by first-priority claims, in whole or in part with cash or securities, \na loan exposure may be guaranteed by a third party, or a bank may buy a credit derivative to offset various \nforms of credit risk. Additionally banks may agree to net loans owed to them against deposits from the \nsame counterparty.66  \n118.  The framework set ou t in this section is applicable to banking book exposures that are risk -\nweighted under the standardised approach.  \n(ii) General requirements \n119. No transaction in which CRM techniques are used shall receive a higher capital requirement than \nan otherwise identical transaction where such techniques are not used.  \n120.  The Pillar 3 requirements must be fulfilled for banks to obtain capital relief in respect of any CRM \ntechniques. \n121. The effects of CRM must not be double-counted. Therefore, no additional supervisory recognition \nof CRM for regulatory capital purposes will be granted on exposures for which the risk weight already \n \n66  In this section, “counterparty” is used to denote a party to whom a bank has an on- or off-balance sheet credit exposure.

Therefore, \nbanks must employ robust procedures and processes to control these risks, including strategy; \nconsideration of the underlying credit; valuation; policies and procedures; systems; control of roll-off risks; \nand management of concentration risk arising from the bank’s use of CRM techniques and its interaction \nwith the bank’s overall credit risk profile. Where these risks are not adequately controlled, supervisors may \nimpose additional capital charges or take other supervisory actions as outlined in Pillar 2. \n123. In order for CRM techniques to provide protection, the credit quality of the counterparty must \nnot have a material positive correlation  with the employed CRM technique or with the resulting residual \nrisks (as defined in paragraph 122). For example, securities issued by the counterparty (or by any \ncounterparty-related entity) provide little protection as collateral and are thus ineligible.  \n124. In the case where a bank has multiple CRM techniques covering a single exposure (eg a bank has \nboth collateral and a guarantee partially covering an exposure), the bank must subdivide the exposure \ninto portions covered by each type of CRM technique (eg portion covered by collateral, portion covered \nby guarantee) and  the risk-weighted assets of each portion must be calculated separately. When credit \nprotection provided by a single protection provider has differing maturities, they must be subdivided into \nseparate protection as well. \n(iii) Legal requirements \n125. In order for banks to obtain capital relief for any use of CRM techniques, all documentation used \nin collateralised transactions, on -balance sheet netting agreements, guarantees and credit derivatives \nmust be binding on all parties and legally enforceable in al l relevant jurisdictions. Banks must have \nconducted sufficient legal review to verify this and have a well-founded legal basis to reach this conclusion, \nand undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability. \n(iv) General treatment of maturity mismatches \n126. For the purposes of calculating risk -weighted assets, a maturity mismatch occurs when the \nresidual maturity of a credit protection arrangement (eg hedge) is less than that of the underlying \nexposure.  \n127.  In the case of financial collateral, maturity mismatches are not allowed under the simple approach \n(see paragraph 147).  \n128.  Under the other approaches, when there is a maturity mismatch the credit protection \narrangement may only be recognised if the ori ginal maturity of the arrangement is greater than or equal \nto one year, and its residual maturity is greater than or equal to three months. In such cases, credit risk \nmitigation may be partially recognised as detailed below in paragraph 129.  \n129. When there is a maturity mismatch with recognised credit risk mitigants, the following adjustment \napplies \n0.25\n0.25\na\ntPP T\n−= ⋅ −  \nwhere: \n• Pa= value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch \n• P = credit protection amount (eg collateral amount, guarantee amount) adjusted for any haircuts", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 38}

The maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the hedge must both be defined \nconservatively. The effective maturity of the underlying must be gauged as the longest possible remaining \ntime before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking into account any applicable grace \nperiod. For the hedge, (embedded) options that may reduce the term of the hedge must be taken into \naccount so that the shortest possible effective maturity is used. For example: where, in the case of a credit \nderivative, the protection seller has a call option, the maturity is the first call date. Likewise, if the protection \nbuyer owns the call option and has a strong incentive to call the transaction at the first call date, for \nexample because of a step-up in cost from this date on, the effective maturity is the remaining time to the \nfirst call date.  \n(v) Currency mismatches \n131. Currency mismatches are allowed under all approaches. Under the simple approach there is no \nspecific treatment for currency mismatches, given that a minimum risk weight of 20% (floor) is generally \napplied. Under the comprehensive approach and in case of guarantees and credit derivatives, a specific \nadjustment for currency mismatches is prescribed in paragraphs 165 and 204, respectively. \n2.  Overview of credit risk mitigation techniques67 \n(i) Collateralised transactions \n132. A collateralised transaction is one in which: \n• banks have a credit exposure or a potential credit exposure; and \n• that credit exposure or potential credit exposure is hedged in whole or in part by collateral posted \nby a counterparty or by a third party on behalf of the counterparty.  \nWhere banks take eligible financial collateral, they may reduce their regulatory capital \nrequirements through the application of CRM techniques. 68  \n133. Banks may opt for either:  \n(i) The simple approach, which replaces the risk weight of the counterparty with the risk weight of \nthe collateral for the collateralised portion of the exposure (generally subject to a 20% floor); or  \n(ii) The comprehensive approach, which allows a more precise offset of collateral against exposures, \nby effectively reducing the exposure amount by a volatility -adjusted value ascribed to the \ncollateral.  \nDetailed operational requirements for both approaches are given in paragraphs 146 to 178. Banks \nmay operate under either, but not both, approaches in the banking book.  \n134.  For collateralised OTC transactions, exchange traded derivatives and long settlement \ntransactions, banks may use the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk ( SA-CCR) or the \nInternal Model Method to calculate the exposure amount, in accordance with paragraph 189. \n \n67  See Annex 10 of Basel II (June 2006) for an overview of methodologies for the capital treatment of transacti ons secured by \nfinancial collateral under the standardised and IRB approaches. \n68  Alternatively, banks with appropriate supervisory approval may instead use the Internal Model Method to determine the \nexposure amount, taking into account collateral.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 39}

Where banks have legally enforceable netting arrangements for loans and deposits that meet the \nconditions in paragraph 190 they may calculate capital requirements on the basis of net credit exposures \nas set out in that paragraph. \n(iii) Guarantees and credit derivatives \n136. Where guarantees or credit derivatives fulfil the minimum operational conditions set out in \nparagraphs 19 1 to 19 3, banks may take account of the credit protection offered by such credit risk \nmitigation techniques in calculating capital requirements. \n137. A range of guarantors and protection providers are recognised and a substitution approach \napplies for capital requirement calculations. Only guarantees issued by or protection provided by entities \nwith a lower risk weight than the counterparty lead to reduced capital charges for the guaranteed \nexposure, since the protected portion of the counterparty exposure is assigned the risk weight of the \nguarantor or protection provider, whereas the uncovered portion retains the risk weight of the underlying \ncounterparty. \n138. Detailed conditions and operational requirements for guarantees and credit derivatives are given \nin paragraphs 191 to 205. \n3.  Collateralised transactions  \n(i)  General requirements  \n139. Before capital relief is granted in respect of any form of collateral, the standards set out below in \nparagraphs 140 to 145 must be met, irrespective of whether the simple or the comprehensive approach is \nused. Banks that lend securities or post collateral must calculate capital requirements for both of the \nfollowing: (i) the credit risk or market risk of the securities, if this remains with the bank; and (ii) the \ncounterparty credit risk arising from the risk that the borrower of the securities may default.  \n140. The legal mechanism by which collateral is pledged or transferred must ensure that the bank has \nthe right to liquidate or take legal possession of it , in a timely manner, in the event of the default, \ninsolvency or bankruptcy (or one or more otherwise -defined credit events set out in the transaction \ndocumentation) of the counterparty (and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral). \nAdditionally, banks must take all steps necessary to fulfil those requirements under the law applicable to \nthe bank’s interest in the collateral for obtaining and maintaining an enforceable security interest, eg by \nregistering it with a registrar, or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to the title transfer of the \ncollateral. \n141. Banks must have clear and robust procedures for the timely liquidation of collateral to ensure \nthat any legal conditions required for declaring the default of the counterparty and liquidating the \ncollateral are observed, and that collateral can be liquidated promptly. \n142. Banks must ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the ord erly operation of margin \nagreements with OTC derivative and securities -financing counterparties, as measured by the timeliness \nand accuracy of its outgoing margin calls and response time to incoming margin calls. Banks must have \ncollateral risk management policies in place to control, monitor and report:  \n• the risk to which margin agreements expose them (such as the volatility and liquidity of the \nsecurities exchanged as collateral);  \n• the concentration risk to particular types of collateral; \n• the reuse of col lateral (both cash and non -cash)", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 40}

Where the collateral is held by a custodian, banks must take reasonable steps to ensure that the \ncustodian segregates the collateral from its own assets. \n144. A capital requirement must be applied on both sides of a transaction. For example, both repos \nand reverse repos will be subject to c apital requirements. Likewise, both sides of a securities lending and \nborrowing transaction will be subject to explicit capital charges, as will the posting of securities in \nconnection with derivatives exposures or with any other borrowing transaction.  \n145. Where a bank, acting as an agent, arranges a repo -style transaction (ie repurchase/reverse \nrepurchase and securities lending/borrowing transactions) between a customer and a third party and \nprovides a guarantee to the customer that the third party will perform on its obligations, then the risk to \nthe bank is the same as if the bank had entered into the transaction as a principal. In such circumstances, \na bank must calculate capital requirements as if it were itself the principal. \n(ii)  The simple approach \nGeneral requirements for the simple approach \n146.  Under the simple approach, the risk weight of the counterparty is replaced by the risk weight of \nthe collateral instrument collateralising or partially collateralising the exposure. \n147. For collateral to be recognised in the simple approach, it must be pledged for at least the life of \nthe exposure and it must be marked to market and revalued with a minimum frequency of six months. \nThose portions of exposures collateralised by the market value of recognised collateral receive the risk \nweight applicable to the collateral instrument. The risk weight on the collateralised portion is subject to a \nfloor of 20% except under the conditions specified in paragraphs 150 to 154. The remainder of the \nexposure must be assigned the risk weight appropriate to the counterparty. Maturity mismatches are not \nallowed under the simple approach (see paragraphs 126 and 127). \nEligible financial collateral under the simple approach \n148.

Subject to certain minimum conditions \nand disclosure requirements, banks that have received supervisory approval to use the IRB approach may \nrely on their own internal estimates of risk components in determining the capital requirement for a given \nexposure. The risk components include measures of the probability of default (PD), loss given default \n(LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and effective maturity (M). In some cases, banks may be required to \nuse a supervisory value as opposed to an internal estimate for one or more of the risk components.  \n2. The IRB approach is based on measures of unexpected losses (UL) and expected losses (EL). The \nrisk-weight functions produce capital requirements for the UL portion. Expected losses are treated \nseparately, as outlined in paragraph 43 of the Basel II framework (June 2006)1 and Section G below.  \n3. In this section, the asset classes are defined first. Adoption of the IRB approach across asset \nclasses is also discussed early in this section. The risk components, each of which is defined later in this \nsection, serve as inputs to the risk -weight functions that have been developed for separate asset classes. \nFor example, there is a risk -weight function for corporate exposures and another one for qualifyin g \nrevolving retail exposures. The treatment of each asset class begins with a presentation of the relevant \nrisk-weight function(s) followed by the risk components and other relevant factors, such as the treatment \nof credit risk mitigants. The legal certainty standards for recognising CRM as set out in paragraphs 117 to \n205 of the standardised approach apply for both the foundation and advanced IRB approaches. The \nminimum requirements that banks must satisfy to use the IRB approach are presented at the end of this \nsection starting at Section H, paragraph 154.  \nB. Mechanics of the IRB approach \n4. In Section 1 that follows, the asset classes (eg  corporate exposures and retail exposures) eligible \nfor the IRB approach are defined. Section 2 provides a description of the risk components to be used by \nbanks by asset class. Section 3 discusses a bank’s adoption of the IRB approach at the asset class level and \nthe related roll-out requirements. In cases where an IRB treatment is not specified, the risk weight for those \nother exposures is 100%, except when a 0% risk weight applies under the standardised approach, and the \nresulting risk-weighted assets are assumed to represent UL only. \n1. Categorisation of exposures \n5. Under the IRB approach, banks must categorise banking -book exposures into broad classes of \nassets with different underlying risk characteristics, subject to the definitions set out below.

The classification of exposures in this way is broadly consistent with established bank practice. \nHowever, some banks may use different definitions in their internal risk management and measurement \nsystems. While it is not the intention of the Committee to require banks to change the way in which they \nmanage their business and risks, banks are required to apply the appropriate treatment to each exposure \nfor the purposes of deriving their minim um capital requirement. Banks must demonstrate to supervisors \nthat their methodology for assigning exposures to different classes is appropriate and consistent over \ntime.  \n7. For the treatment of securitisation exposures, see the Committee’s Revisions to the securitisation \nframework.\n2  \n(i) Definition of corporate exposures \n8. In general, a corporate exposure is defined as a debt obligation of a corporation, partnership, or \nproprietorship. Banks are permitted to distinguish separately exposures to small- and medium-sized \nentities (SME), as defined in paragraph 54.  \n9. In addition to general corporates, within the corporate asset class, five sub-classes of specialised \nlending (SL) are identified. Such lending possesses all the following characteristics, either  in legal form or \neconomic substance: \n• The exposure is typically to an entity (often a special purpose entity (SPE)) which was created \nspecifically to finance and/or operate physical assets;  \n• The borrowing entity has little or no other material assets or activities, and therefore little or no \nindependent capacity to repay the obligation, apart from the income that it receives from the \nasset(s) being financed;  \n• The terms of the obligation give the lender a substantial degree of control over the asset(s) and \nthe income that it generates; and  \n• As a result of the preceding factors, the primary source of repayment of the obligation is the \nincome generated by the asset(s), rather than the independent capacity of a broader commercial \nenterprise.  \n10. The five sub-classes of specialised lending (SL) are project finance, object finance, commodities \nfinance, income-producing real estate, and high-volatility commercial real estate. Each of these sub-classes \nis defined below. \nProject finance \n11. Project finance (PF) is a method of funding in which the lender looks primarily to the revenues \ngenerated by a single project, both as the source of repayment and as security for the exposure. This type \nof financing is usually for large, complex and expensive installations that might include, for example, power \nplants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and \ntelecommunications infrastructure. Project finance may take the form of financing of the construction of \na new capital installation, or refinancing of an existing installation, with or without improvements.  \n12. In such transactions, the lender is usually paid solely or almost exclusively out of the money \ngenerated by the contracts for the facility’s output, such as the electricity sold by a power plant. The \nborrower is usually an SPE that is not permitted to perform any function other than developing, owning, \nand operating the installation. The consequence is that repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash \nflow and on the collateral value of the project’s assets.

Object finance (OF) refers to a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (eg ships, \naircraft, satellites, railcars, and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows \ngenerated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary \nsource of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties. In contrast, \nif the exposure is to a borrower whose financial condition and debt -servicing capacity enables it to repay \nthe debt without undue reliance on the specifically pledged assets, the exposure should be treated as a \ncollateralised corporate exposure.  \nCommodities finance \n14. Commodities finance (CF) refers to structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, \nor receivables of exchange -traded commodities (eg crude oil, metals, or crops), where the exposure will \nbe repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity \nto repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other material \nassets on its balance sheet. The structured nature of the financing is designed to compensate for the weak \ncredit quality of the borrower. The exposure’s rating reflects its self-liquidating nature and the lender’s skill \nin structuring the transaction rather than the credit quality of the borrower.  \n15. The Committee believes that such lending can be distinguished from exposures financing the \nreserves, inventories, or receivables of other more diversified corporate borrowers. Banks are able to rate \nthe credit quality of the latter type of borrowers based on their broader ongoing operations. In such cases, \nthe value of the commodity serves as a risk mitigant rather than as the primary source of repayment.  \nIncome-producing real estate \n16. Income-producing real estate (IPRE) refers to a method of providing funding to real estate (such \nas, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and \nhotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash \nflows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental \npayments or the sale of the asset. The borrower may be, but is not required to be, an SPE, an operating \ncompany focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an operating company with sources of \nrevenue other than real estate. The distinguishing characteristic of IPRE versus o ther corporate exposures \nthat are collateralised by real estate is the strong positive correlation between the prospects for repayment \nof the exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending primarily on \nthe cash flows generated by a property. \nHigh-volatility commercial real estate  \n17. High-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) lending is the financing of commercial real estate \nthat exhibits higher loss rate volatility (ie higher asset correlation) compared to other types of SL. \nHVCRE includes:  \n• Commercial real estate exposures secured by properties of types that are categorised by the \nnational supervisor as sharing higher volatilities in portfolio default", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 59}

Bank exposures also \ninclude claims on all domestic PSEs that are not treated as exposures to sovereigns under the standardised \napproach, and MDBs that do not meet the criteria for a 0% risk weight under the standardised approach  \n(ie MDBs that are not listed in footnote 11 of the standardised approach).  \n(iv) Definition of retail exposures \n21.

Small business loans extended \nthrough or guaranteed by an individual are subject to the same exposure threshold.  \n• It is expected that supervisors provide flexibility in the practical application of such thresholds \nsuch that banks are not forced to develop extensive new information systems simply for the \npurpose of ensuring perfect compliance. It is, however, important for supervisors to ensure that \nsuch flexibility (and the implied acceptance of exposure amounts in excess of the thresholds that \nare not treated as violations) is not being abused. \nLarge number of exposures \n22. The exposure must be one of a large pool of exposures, which are managed by the bank on a \npooled basis.  \n• Small business exposures below €1 million may be treated as retail exposures if the bank treats \nsuch exposures in its internal risk management systems consistently over time and in the same \nmanner as other retail exposures. This requires t hat such an exposure be originated in a similar \nmanner to other retail exposures. Furthermore, it must not be managed individually in a way \ncomparable to corporate exposures, but rather as part of a portfolio segment or pool of \nexposures with similar risk characteristics for purposes of risk assessment and quantification. \nHowever, this does not preclude retail exposures from being treated individually at some stages \nof the risk management process. The fact that an exposure is rated individually does not by itself \ndeny the eligibility as a retail exposure. \n23.

All of the following criteria must be satisfied for a sub- portfolio to be treated as a qualifying \nrevolving retail exposure (QRRE). These criteria must be applied at a sub-portfolio level consistent with the \nbank’s segmentation of its retail activities generally. Segmentation at the national or country level (or \nbelow) should be the general rule. \n(a) The exposures are revol ving, unsecured, and uncommitted (both contractually and in practice). \nIn this context, revolving exposures are defined as those where customers’ outstanding balances \nare permitted to fluctuate based on their decisions to borrow and repay, up to a limit established \nby the bank.  \n(b) The exposures are to individuals. \n(c) The maximum exposure to a single individual in the sub-portfolio is €100,000 or less. \n(d) Because the asset correlation assumptions for the QRRE risk-weight function are markedly below \nthose for the other retail risk-weight function at low PD values, banks must demonstrate that the \nuse of the QRRE risk-weight function is constrained to portfolios that have exhibited low volatility \nof loss rates, relative to their average level of loss rates, especially w ithin the low PD bands. \nSupervisors will review the relative volatility of loss rates across the QRRE subportfolios, as well \nas the aggregate QRRE portfolio,", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 61}

The QRRE sub-class is split into exposures to transactors and revolvers. A QRRE transactor is an \nexposure to an obligor that meets the definition set out in paragraph 56 of the standardised approach. \nThat is, the exposure is to an obligor in relation to a facility such as credit card or charge card where the \nbalance has been repaid in full at each scheduled repayment date for the previous 12 months, or the \nexposure is in relation to an overdraft facility if there have been  no drawdowns over the previous 12 \nmonths.

Eligible purchased receivables are divided into retail and corporate receivables as defined below.  \nRetail receivables \n28. Purchased retail receivables, provided the purchasing bank complies with the IRB rules for retail \nexposures, are eligible for the top -down approach as permitted within the existing standards for retail \nexposures. The bank must also apply the minimum operational requirements as set forth in Sections F and \nH. \nCorporate receivables \n29. In general, for purchased corporate receivables, banks are expected to assess the default risk of \nindividual obligors as specified in Section C.1 (starting with paragraph 52) consistent with the treatment \nof other corporate exposures. However, the top -down approach may be used, provided that the \npurchasing bank’s programme for corporate receivables complies with both the criteria for eligible \nreceivables and the minimum opera tional requirements of this approach. The use of the top -down \npurchased receivables treatment is limited to situations where it would be an undue burden on a bank to \nbe subjected to the minimum requirements for the IRB approach to corporate exposures that would \notherwise apply. Primarily, it is intended for receivables that are purchased for inclusion in asset -backed \nsecuritisation structures, but banks may also use this approach, with the approval of national supervisors, \nfor appropriate on-balance sheet exposures that share the same features. \n30. Supervisors may deny the use of the top -down approach for purchased corporate receivables \ndepending on the bank’s compliance with minimum requirements. In particular, to be eligible for the \nproposed ‘top-down’ treatment, purchased corporate receivables must satisfy the following conditions:  \n• The receivables are purchased from unrelated, third party sellers, and as such the bank has not \noriginated the receivables either directly or indirectly.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 62}

The existence of full or partial recourse to the seller does not automatically disqualify a bank from \nadopting this top-down approach, as long as the cash flows from the purchased corporate receivables are \nthe primary protection against default risk as determined by the rules in paragraphs 132 to 135 for \npurchased receivables and the bank meets the eligibility criteria and operational requirements.  \n2. Foundation and advanced approaches  \n32. For each of the asset classes covered under the IRB framework, there are three key elements:  \n• Risk components: estimates of risk parameters provided by banks, some of which are supervisory \nestimates. \n• Risk-weight functions: the means by which risk components are transformed into risk -weighted \nassets and therefore capital requirements. \n• Minimum requirements: the minimum standards that must be met in order for a bank to use the \nIRB approach for a given asset class.  \n33. For many of the asset classes, the Committee has made available two broad approaches: a \nfoundation and an advanced approach. Under the foundation approach (F -IRB approach), as a general \nrule, banks provide their own estimates of PD and rely on supervisory estimates for other risk components. \nUnder the advanced approach (A-IRB approach), banks provide more of their own estimates of PD, LGD \nand EAD, and their own calculation of M, subject to meeting minimum standards. For both the foundation \nand advanced approaches, banks must always use the risk- weight functions provided in this Framework \nfor the purpose of deriving capital requirements. The full suite of approaches is described below.  \n34. For exposures to equities, defined in paragraph 26 above, the IRB approaches are not permitted  \n(see paragraph 42). In addition, the A-IRB approach cannot be used for the following: \n(i) Exposures to general corporates belonging to a group with total consolidated annual revenues \ngreater than €500m. \n(ii) Exposures in the bank asset class (paragraph 20), and other securities firms and finan cial \ninstitutions (including insurance companies and any other financial institutions in the corporate \nasset class). \nIn making the assessment above for the revenue threshold, the amounts must be as reported in \nthe audited financial statements of the corporates or, for corporates that are part of consolidated groups, \n \n5 Contra-accounts involve a customer buying from and selling to", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 63}

For eligible corporate receivables, both a \nfoundation and advanced approach are available subject to certain operational requirements being met. \nAs noted in paragraph 29, for corporate purchased receivables banks are in general expected to  assess \nthe default risk of individual obligors. The bank may use the A -IRB treatment for purchased corporate \nreceivables (paragraphs 134 and 135) only for exposures to individual corporate obligors that are eligible \nfor the A-IRB approach according to paragraph 34. Otherwise, the F-IRB treatment for purchased corporate \nreceivables should be used. For eligible retail receivables, as with the retail asset class, only the A -IRB \napproach is available.  \n3.

Onc e a bank adopts an IRB approach for part of its holdings within an asset class, it is expected \nto extend it across all holdings within that asset class. In this context, the relevant assets classes are as \nfollows:  \n• Banks \n• Corporates (excluding specialised lending and purchased receivables) \n• Specialised lending \n• Corporate purchased receivables \n• Qualifying revolving retail exposures \n• Retail residential mortgages \n• Other retail (excluding purchased receivables) \n• Retail purchased receivables \nThe Committee recognises h owever, that, for many banks, it may not be practicable for various \nreasons to implement the IRB approach for an entire asset class across all business units at the same time. \nFurthermore, once on IRB, data limitations may mean that banks can meet the stan dards for the use of \nown estimates of LGD and EAD for some but not all of their exposures within an asset classes at the same \ntime (for example, exposures that are in the same asset class, but are in different business units).  \n45. As such, supervisors may allow banks to adopt a phased rollout of the IRB approach across an \nasset class. The phased rollout includes: (i) adoption of IRB across the asset class within the same business \nunit; (ii) adoption of IRB for the asset class across business units in the same banking group; and (iii) move \nfrom the foundation approach to the advanced approach for certain risk components where use of the \nadvanced approach is permitted.

The derivation of risk -weighted assets is dependent on estimates of the PD, LGD, EAD and, in \nsome cases, effective maturity (M), for a given exposure.  \n53.

For banks using the foundation approach for LGD, the approach to guarantees and credit \nderivatives closely follows the treatment under the standardised approach as specified  in paragraphs 191 \nto 205 of the standardised approach . The range of eligible guarantors is the same as under the \nstandardised approach except that companies that are internally rated may also be recognised under the \nfoundation approach. To receive recognition, the requirements outlined in paragraphs 191 to 196 of the \nstandardised approach must be met.  \n93. Eligible guarantees from eligible guarantors will be recognised as follows:  \n• For the covered portion of the exposure, a risk weight is derived by taking:  \n− the risk-weight function appropriate to the type of guarantor, and  \n− the PD appropriate to the guarantor’s borrower grade.  \n• The bank may replace the LGD of the underlying transaction with the LGD applicable to the \nguarantee taking into account seniority and any co llateralisation of a guaranteed commitment. \nFor example, when a bank has a subordinated claim on the borrower but the guarantee \nrepresents a senior claim on the guarantor this may be reflected by using an LGD applicable for \nsenior exposures (see paragraph 70) instead of an LGD applicable for subordinated exposures.  \n• In case the bank applies the standardised approach to direct exposures to the guarantor it may \nonly recognise the guarantee by applying the standardised approach to the covered portion of \nthe exposure. \n94. The uncovered portion of the exposure is assigned the risk weight associated with the underlying \nobligor. \n95. Where partial coverage exists, or where there is a currency mismatch between the underlying \nobligation and the credit protection, it is necessary to split the exposure into a covered and an uncovered \namount.

Banks using the advanced approach for estimating LGDs may reflect the risk-mitigating effect of \nguarantees and credit derivatives through either adjusting PD or LGD estimates.

In \ncase the bank applies the standardised approach to direct exposures to the guarantor it must assign t he \nstandardised approach risk weight to the covered portion of the exposure. \n123. Consistent with the requirements outlined above for corporate and bank exposures, banks must \nnot include the effect of double default in such adjustments. The adjusted risk weight must not be less \nthan that of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider. Consistent with the standardised \napproach, banks may choose not to recognise credit protection if doing so would result in a higher capital \nrequirement. \n(iii) Exposure at default (EAD) \n124. Both on and off-balance sheet retail exposures are measured gross of specific provisions or partial \nwrite-offs. The EAD on drawn amounts should not be less than the sum of: (i) the amount by which a \nbank’s regulatory capital woul d be reduced if the exposure were written -off fully; and (ii) any specific \nprovisions and partial write -offs.

When only the drawn balances of revolving retail facilities have been securitised, banks must \nensure that they continue to hold required capital against the undrawn balances associated with the \nsecuritised exposures using the IRB approach to credit risk for commitments. \n128. To the extent that foreign exchange and interest rate commitments exist within a bank’s retail \nportfolio for IRB purposes, banks are not permitted to provide their internal assessments of credit \nequivalent amounts. Instead, the rules for the standardised approach continue to apply.  \nF. Rules for purchased receivables  \n129. Section F presents the method of calculating the UL capital requirements for purchased \nreceivables. For such assets, there are IRB capital charges for both default risk and dilution risk. Section F.1 \ndiscusses the calculation of risk -weighted assets for default risk. The calculation of risk -weighted assets \nfor dilution risk is provided in Section F.2. The method of calculating expected losses, and for determining \nthe difference between that measure and provisions, is described in Section G.  \n1. Risk-weighted assets for default risk \n130. For receivables belonging unambiguously to one asset class, the IRB risk weight for default risk \nis based on the risk -weight function applicable to that particular exposure type, as long as the bank can \nmeet the qualification standards for this particular risk- weight function. For example, if banks cannot \ncomply with the standards for qualifying revolving retail exposures (defined in paragraph 24), they should \nuse the risk-weight function for other retail exposures. For hybrid pools containing mixtures of exposure \ntypes, if the purchasing bank cannot separate the exposures by type, the risk -weight function producing \nthe highest capital requirements for the exposure types in the receivable pool applies.  \n(i) Purchased retail receivables \n131. For purchased retail receivables, a bank must meet the risk quantification standards for retail \nexposures but can utilise external and internal reference data to estimate the PDs and LGDs. The estimates \nfor PD and LGD (or EL) must be calculated for the receivables on a stand-alone basis; that is, without regard \nto any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.  \n(ii) Purchased corporate receivables \n132. For purchased corporate receivables the purchasing bank is expected to apply the existing IRB \nrisk quantification standards for the bottom -up approach.

{"text": "78 Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms \n \n \n• Given the EL estimate for the pool’s default losses, the risk weight for default risk is determined \nby the risk-weight function for corporate exposures.19 As described below, the precise calculation \nof risk weights for default risk depends on the bank’s ability to decompose EL into its PD and \nLGD components in a reliable manner. Banks can utilise external and internal data  to estimate \nPDs and LGDs. However, the advanced approach will not be available for banks that use the \nfoundation approach for corporate exposures. \nFoundation IRB treatment \n133. If the purchasing bank is unable to decompose EL into its PD and LGD components in a reliable \nmanner, the risk weight is determined from the corporate risk -weight function using the following \nspecifications: if the bank can demonstrate that the exposures are exclusively senior claims to corporate \nborrowers, an LGD of 40% can be used . PD will be calculated by dividing the EL using this LGD. EAD will \nbe calculated as the outstanding amount minus the capital charge for dilution prior to credit risk mitigation \n(K\nDilution). Otherwise, PD is the bank’s estimate of EL; LGD will be 100%; and EAD is the amount outstanding \nminus KDilution. EAD for a revolving purchase facility is the sum of the current amount of receivables \npurchased plus 40% of any undrawn purchase commitments minus KDilution. If the purchasing bank is able \nto estimate PD in a reliable manner, the risk weight is determined from the corporate risk-weight functions \naccording to the specifications for LGD, M and the treatment of guarantees under the foundation approach \nas given in paragraphs 70 to 83, 89 to 95, and 107. \nAdvanced IRB treatment \n134. If the purchasing bank can estimate either the pool’s default -weighted average loss rates given \ndefault (as defined in paragraph 235) or average PD in a reliable manner, the bank may estimate the other \nparameter based on an estimate of the expected long -run loss rate. The bank may: (i) use an appropriate \nPD estimate to infer the long -run default-weighted average loss rate given default; or (ii) use a long -run \ndefault-weighted average loss rate given default to infer the appropriate PD. In either case, it is important \nto recognise that the LGD used for the IRB capital calculation for purchased receivables cannot be less \nthan the long -run default -weighted average loss rate given default and must be consistent with the \nconcepts defined in paragraph 235. The risk weight for the purchased receivables will be determined using \nthe bank’s estimated PD and LGD as inputs to the corporate risk-weight function. Similar to the foundation \nIRB treatment, EAD will be the amount outstanding minus KDilution. EAD for a revolving purchase facility will \nbe the sum of the current amount of receivables purchased plus 40% of any undrawn purchase \ncommitments minus KDilution (thus, banks using the advanced IRB approach will not be permitted to use \ntheir internal EAD estimates for undrawn purchase commitments).  \n135.

Risk-weighted assets for dilution risk \n136. Dilution refers to the possibility that the receivable amount is reduced through cash or non-cash \ncredits to the receivable’s obligor. 20  For both corporate and retail receivables, unless the bank can \ndemonstrate to its supervisor that the dilution risk for the purchasing bank is immaterial, the treatment of \ndilution risk must be the following: at the level of either the pool as a whole (top -down approach) or the \nindividual receivables making up the pool (bottom -up approach), the purchasing bank will estimate the \none-year EL for dilution risk, also expressed in percentage of the receivables amount. Banks can utilise \nexternal and internal data to estimate EL. As with the treatments of default risk, this estimate must be \ncomputed on a stand-alone basis; that is, under the assumption of no recourse or other support from the \nseller or third-party guarantors. For the purpose of calculating risk weights for dilution risk, the corporate \nrisk-weight function must be used with the following settings: the PD must be set equal to the estimated \nEL, and the LGD must be set at 100%. An appropriate maturity treatment applies when determining the \ncapital requirement for dilution risk. If a bank can demonstrate that the dilution risk is appropriately \nmonitored and managed to be resolved within one year, the supervisor may allow the bank to apply a \none-year maturity. \n137. This treatment will be applied regardless of whether the underlying receivables are corporate or \nretail exposures, and regardless of whether the risk weights for default risk are computed using the \nstandard IRB treatments or, for corporate receivables, the top-down treatment described above.  \n3. Treatment of purchase price discounts for receivables \n138. In many cases, the p urchase price of receivables will reflect a discount (not to be confused with \nthe discount concept defined in paragraphs 98 and 124) that provides first loss protection for default \nlosses, dilution losses or both.

Recognition of credit risk mitigants \n140. Credit risk mitigants will be recognised generally using the same type of framework as set forth \nin paragraphs 90 to 97. 21 In particular, a guarantee provided by the seller or a third party will be treated \nusing the existing IRB rules for guarantees, regardless of whether the guarantee covers default risk, dilution \nrisk, or both.  \n• If the guarantee covers both the pool’s default risk and dilution risk, the bank will substitute the \nrisk weight for an exposure to the guarantor in place of the pool’s total risk weight for default \nand dilution risk.  \n• If the guarantee covers only default risk or dilution risk, but not both, the bank will substitute the \nrisk weight for an exposure to the guarantor in place of the pool’s risk weight for the \ncorresponding risk component (default or dilution). The capital requirement for the other \ncomponent will then be added. \n• If a guarantee covers only a portion of the default and/or dilution risk, the uncovered portion of \nthe default and/or dilution risk will be treated as per the existing CRM rules for proportional or \ntranched coverage (ie the risk weights of the uncovered risk components will be added to the \nrisk weights of the covered risk components).  \nG. Treatment of expected losses and recognition of provisions \n141. Section G discusses the method by which the difference between provisions (eg specific \nprovisions, portfolio-specific general provisions such as country risk provisions or general provisions) and \nexpected losses may be included in or must be deducted from regulatory capital, as outlined in the \ndefinition of capital section of the Basel III framework (June 2011).  \n1. Calculation of expected losses  \n142. A bank must sum the EL amount (defined as EL multiplied by EAD) associated with its exposures \nto which the IRB approach is applied (excluding the EL amount associated wi th securitisation exposures) \nto obtain a total EL amount. The treatment of EL for securitisation exposures is described in paragraph 37 \nof the securitisation framework.  \n(i) Expected loss for exposures other than exposures subject to the supervisory slotting \ncriteria \n143. Banks must calculate EL as PD x LGD for corporate, bank, and retail exposures not in default. For \ncorporate, bank, and retail exposures that are in default, banks must use their best estimate of expected \nloss as defined in paragraph 238 for exposures subject to the advanced approach and for exposures \nsubject to the foundation approach banks must use the supervisory LGD. For exposures subject to the \nsupervisory slotting criteria EL is calculated as described in paragraphs 144 to 146.

Calculation of provisions \n(i) Exposures subject to the IRB approach \n147. Total eligible provisions are defined as the sum of all provisions (eg specific provisions, partial \nwrite-offs, portfolio-specific general provisions such as country risk provisions or general provisions) that \nare attributed to exposures treated under the IRB approach. In addition, total eligible provisions may \ninclude any discounts on defaulted assets. Specific provisions set aside against securitisation exposures \nmust not be included in total eligible provisions.  \n(ii) Portion of exposures subject to the standardised approach for credit risk  \n148.

As specified in paragraphs 61 and 73 of the Basel III framework (June 2011), banks using the IRB \napproach must compare the total amount of total eligible provisions (as defined in paragraph 147) with \nthe total EL amount as calculated within the IRB approach (as defined in paragraph 142). In addition, \nparagraph 60 of the Basel III framework (June 2011) outlines the treatment for that portion of a bank that \nis subject to the standardised approach for credit risk when the bank uses both the standardised and IRB \napproaches. \n152. Where the calculated EL amount is lower than the total eligible provisions of the bank, its \nsupervisors must consider whether the EL fully reflects the conditions in the market in which it opera tes \nbefore allowing the difference to be included in Tier 2 capital. If specific provisions exceed the EL amount \non defaulted assets this assessment also needs to be made before using the difference to offset the EL \namount on non-defaulted assets. \n153. The treatment of EL and provisions related to securitisation exposures is outlined in paragraph \n37 of the securitisation framework. \nH. Minimum requirements for IRB approach \n154. Section H presents the minimum requirements for entry and on -going use of the IRB approach. \nThe minimum requirements are set out in 12 separate sections concerning: (a) composition of minimum \nrequirements; (b) compliance with minimum requirements; (c) rating system design; (d) risk rating system \noperations; (e) corporate governance and  oversight; (f) use of internal ratings; (g) risk quantification; (h) \nvalidation of internal estimates; (i) supervisory LGD and EAD estimates; (j) requirements for recognition of \nleasing; (k) calculation of capital charges for equity exposures; and (l) disclosure requirements. It may be \nhelpful to note that the minimum requirements cut across asset classes. Therefore, more than one asset \nclass may be discussed within the context of a given minimum requirement.  \n1. Composition of minimum requirements \n155. To be eligible for the IRB approach a bank must demonstrate to its supervisor that it meets certain \nminimum requirements at the outset and on an ongoing basis. Many of these  requirements are in the \nform of objectives that a qualifying bank’s risk rating systems must fulfil. The focus is on banks’ abilities to \nrank order and quantify risk in a consistent, reliable and valid fashion.  \n156. The overarching principle behind these requirements is that rating and risk estimation systems \nand processes provide for a meaningful assessment of borrower and transaction characteristics; a \nmeaningful differentiation of risk; and reasonably accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. \nFurthermore, the systems and processes must be consistent with internal use of t hese estimates.

{"text": "Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms 83 \n \n \nthe related oversight, validation, etc) apply equally to the process of assigning retail exposures to pools of \nhomogenous exposures, unless noted otherwise.  \n158. The minimum requirements set out in this document apply to both foundation and advanced \napproaches unless noted otherwise. Generally, all IRB banks must produce their own estima tes of PD 22 \nand must adhere to the overall requirements for rating system design, operations, controls, and corporate \ngovernance, as well as the requisite requirements for estimation and validation of PD measures. Banks \nwishing to use their own estimates of  LGD and EAD must also meet the incremental minimum \nrequirements for these risk factors included in paragraphs 235 to 263.  \n2. Compliance with minimum requirements \n159. To be eligible for an IRB approach, a bank must demonstrate to its supervisor that it m eets the \nIRB requirements in this document, at the outset and on an ongoing basis. Banks’ overall credit risk \nmanagement practices must also be consistent with the evolving sound practice guidelines issued by the \nCommittee and national supervisors. \n160. There may be circumstances when a bank is not in complete compliance with all the minimum \nrequirements. Where this is the case, the bank must produce a plan for a timely return to compliance, and \nseek approval from its supervisor, or the bank must demonstrat e that the effect of such non -compliance \nis immaterial in terms of the risk posed to the institution. Failure to produce an acceptable plan or \nsatisfactorily implement the plan or to  demonstrate immateriality will lead supervisors to reconsider the \nbank’s eligibility for the IRB approach. Furthermore, for the duration of any non- compliance, supervisors \nwill consider the need for the bank to hold additional capital under Pillar 2 or take other appropriate \nsupervisory action.  \n3. Rating system design \n161. The term “rating system” comprises all of the methods, processes, controls, and data collection \nand IT systems that support the assessment of credit risk, the assignment of internal risk ratings, and the \nquantification of default and loss estimates.  \n162. Within each asset class, a bank may utilise multiple rating methodologies/systems. For example, \na bank may have customised rating systems for specific industries or market segments (eg middle market, \nand large corporate). If a bank chooses to use multiple sys tems, the rationale for assigning a borrower to \na rating system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the level of risk of the \nborrower. Banks must not allocate borrowers across rating systems inappropriately to minimise regulatory \ncapital requirements (ie cherry -picking by choice of rating system). Banks must demonstrate that each \nsystem used for IRB purposes is in compliance with the minimum requirements at the outset and on an \nongoing basis.  \n(i) Rating dimensions \nStandards for corporate and bank exposures \n163. A qualifying IRB rating system must have two separate and distinct dimensions: (i) the risk of \nborrower default; and (ii) transaction-specific factors.  \n164.

Secondly, when the treatment of associated guarantees to a facility may be \nreflected in an adjusted borrower grade. In either case, separ ate exposures may result in multiple grades \nfor the same borrower. A bank must articulate in its credit policy the relationship between borrower grades \nin terms of the level of risk each grade implies. Perceived and measured risk must increase as credit quality \ndeclines from one grade to the next. The policy must articulate the risk of each grade in terms of both a \ndescription of the probability of default risk typical for borrowers assigned the grade and the criteria used \nto distinguish that level of credit risk.  \n165. The second dimension must reflect transaction-specific factors, such as collateral, seniority, \nproduct type, etc. For exposures subject to the foundation IRB approach, this requirement can be fulfilled \nby the existence of a facility dimension, which reflects both borrower and transaction-specific factors. For \nexample, a rating dimension that reflects EL by incorporating both borrower strength (PD) and loss severity \n(LGD) considerations would qualify. Likewise a rating system that exclusively r eflects LGD would qualify. \nWhere a rating dimension reflects EL and does not separately quantify LGD, the supervisory estimates of \nLGD must be used.  \n166. For banks using the advanced approach, facility ratings must reflect exclusively LGD. These ratings \ncan reflect any and all factors that can influence LGD including, but not limited to, the type of collateral, \nproduct, industry, and purpose. Borrower characteristics may be included as LGD rating criteria only to the \nextent they are predictive of LGD. Banks may alter the factors that influence facility grades across segments \nof the portfolio as long as they can satisfy their supervisor that it improves the relevance and precision of \ntheir estimates.  \n167. Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria are exempt from this two -dimensional requirement \nfor these exposures. Given the interdependence between borrower/transaction characteristics in \nexposures subject to the supervisory slotting approaches, banks may satisfy the requirements under this \nheading through a single rating dimension that reflects EL by incorporating both borrower strength (PD) \nand loss severity (LGD) considerations. This exemption does not apply to banks using the general \ncorporate foundation or advanced approach for the SL sub-class.  \nStandards for retail exposures \n168. Rating systems for retail exposures must be oriented to both borrower and transaction risk, and \nmust capture all relevant borrower and transaction characteristics. Banks must assign each exposure that \nfalls within the definition of retail for IRB purposes into a particular pool. Banks must demonstrate that this \nprocess provides for a meaningful differentiation of risk, provides for a grouping of sufficiently \nhomogenous exposures, and allows for accurate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at pool \nlevel.  \n169. For each pool, banks must estimate PD, LGD, and EAD. Multiple pools may share identical PD, \nLGD and EAD estimates. At a minimum, banks should consider the following risk drivers when assigning \nexposures to a pool: \n• Borrower risk characteristics (eg borrower type, demographics such as age/occupation);  \n• Transaction risk characteristics, including product and/or collateral types (eg loan to value \nmeasures, season", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 88}

A bank must have a meaningful distribution of exposures across grades with no excessive \nconcentrations, on both its borrower-rating and its facility-rating scales.  \n171. To meet this objective, a bank must have a minimum of seven borrower grades for non-defaulted \nborrowers and one for those that have defaulted. Banks with lending activities focused on a particular \nmarket segment may satisfy this requirement with the minimum number of grad es.  \n172. A borrower grade is defined as an assessment of borrower risk on the basis of a specified and \ndistinct set of rating criteria, from which estimates of PD are derived. The grade definition must include \nboth a description of the degree of default r isk typical for borrowers assigned the grade and the criteria \nused to distinguish that level of credit risk. Furthermore, “+” or “ -” modifiers to alpha or numeric grades \nwill only qualify as distinct grades if the bank has developed complete rating descriptions and criteria for \ntheir assignment, and separately quantifies PDs for these modified grades. \n173. Banks with loan portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of default risk \nmust have enough grades within that range to avoid undue  concentrations of borrowers in particular \ngrades. Significant concentrations within a single grade or grades must be supported by convincing \nempirical evidence that the grade or grades cover reasonably narrow PD bands and that the default risk \nposed by all borrowers in a grade fall within that band.  \n174. There is no specific minimum number of facility grades for banks using the advanced approach \nfor estimating LGD. A bank must have a sufficient number of facility grades to avoid grouping facilities \nwith widely varying LGDs into a single grade. The criteria used to define facility grades must be grounded \nin empirical evidence.  \n175. Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria must have at least four grades for non -defaulted \nborrowers, and one for defaulte d borrowers. The requirements for SL exposures that qualify for the \ncorporate foundation and advanced approaches are the same as those for general corporate exposures.  \nStandards for retail exposures \n176. For each pool identified, the bank must be able to provide quantitative measures of loss \ncharacteristics (PD, LGD, and EAD) for that pool.

To ensure that banks are consistently taking into account available information, they must use all \nrelevant and material information in assigning ratings to borrowers and facilities. Information must be \ncurrent. The less information a bank has, the more conservative must be its assignments of exposures to \nborrower and facility grades or pools. An external rating can be the primary factor determining an internal \nrating assignment; however, the bank must ensure that it considers other relevant information.  \nExposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach \n179. Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria must assign exposures to their internal rating grades \nbased on their own criteria, systems and processes, subject to compliance with the requisite minimum \nrequirements. Banks must then map these internal rating grades into the five supervisory rating categories. \nTables 1 to 4 in Annex 6 of the Basel II framework (June 2006) provide, for each sub-class of SL exposures, \nthe general assessment factors and characteristics exhibited by the exposures that fall under each of the \nsupervisory categories. Each lending activity has a unique table describing the assessment factors and \ncharacteristics.  \n180. The Committee recognises that the criteria that banks use to assign exposures to internal grades \nwill not perfectly align with crit eria that define the supervisory categories; however, banks must \ndemonstrate that their mapping process has resulted in an alignment of grades which is consistent with \nthe preponderance of the characteristics in the respective supervisory category. Banks should take special \ncare to ensure that any overrides of their internal criteria do not render the mapping process ineffective.  \n(iv) Rating assignment horizon \n181. Although the time horizon used in PD estimation is one year (as described in paragraph 215) , \nbanks are expected to use a longer time horizon in assigning ratings.  \n182. A borrower rating must represent the bank’s assessment of the borrower’s ability and willingness \nto contractually perform despite adverse economic conditions or the occurrence of unexpected events. \nThe range of economic conditions that are considered when making assessments must be consistent with \ncurrent conditions and those that are likely to occur over a business cycle within the respective \nindustry/geographic region. Rating syst ems should be designed in such a way that idiosyncratic or \nindustry-specific changes are a driver of migrations from one category to another, and business cycle \neffects may also be a driver. \n183.

The requirements in this section apply to statistical models and other mechanical methods used \nto assign borrower or facility ratings or in estimation of PDs, LGDs, or EADs. Credit scoring models and \nother mechanical rating procedures generally use only a subset of available information. Although \nmechanical rating procedures may sometimes avoid some of the idiosyncratic errors made by rating \nsystems in which human judgement plays a large role, mechanical use of limited information also is a \nsource of rating errors. Credit scoring models an d other mechanical procedures are permissible as the \nprimary or partial basis of rating assignments, and may play a role in the estimation of loss characteristics. \nSufficient human judgement and human oversight is necessary to ensure that all relevant and material \ninformation, including that which is outside the scope of the model, is also taken into consideration, and \nthat the model is used appropriately.  \n• The burden is on the bank to satisfy its supervisor that a model or procedure has good predictive \npower and that regulatory capital requirements will not be distorted as a result of its use.

Use of a model obtained from a third -party vendor that claims proprietary technology is not a \njustification for exemption from documentation or any other of the requirements for internal rating \nsystems. The burden is on the model’s vendor and the bank to satisfy supervisors.  \n4. Risk rating system operations \n(i) Coverage of ratings \n190. For corporate, and bank exposures,  each borrower and all recognised guarantors must be \nassigned a rating and each exposure must be associated with a facility rating as part of the loan approval \nprocess. Similarly, for retail, each exposure must be assigned to a pool as part of the loan approval process. \n191. Each separate legal entity to which the bank is exposed must be separately rated. A bank must \nhave policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding the treatment of individual entities in a connected \ngroup including circumstances under which the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all \nrelated entities. Those policies must include a process for the identification of specific wrong way risk for \neach legal entity to which the bank is exposed. Transactions with counterparties where specific wrong way \nrisk has been identified need to be treated differently when calculating the EAD for such exposures (see \nparagraph 58 of the counterparty credit risk standards). \n(ii) Integrity of rating process \nStandards for corporate and bank exposures \n192. Rating assignments and periodic rating reviews must be completed or approved by a party that \ndoes not directly stand to benefit from the extension of credit. Independence of the rating assignment \nprocess can be achieved through a range of practices that will be carefully reviewed by supervisors.

Certain \ncredits, especially higher risk borrowers or problem exposures, must be subject to more frequent review. \nIn addition, banks must initiate a new rating if material information on the borrower or facility comes to \nlight. \n194. The bank must have an effective process to obtain and update relevant and material information \non the borrower’s financial condition, and on facility characteristics that affect LGDs and EADs (such as the \ncondition of collateral).

This requirement may be satisfied \nby review of a representative sample of exposures in the pool. \n(iii) Overrides \n196. For rating assignments based on expert judgement, banks must clearly articulate the situations \nin which bank officers may override the outputs of the rating process, including how and to what extent \nsuch overrides can be used and by whom. For model -based ratings, the bank must have guidelines and \nprocesses for monitoring cases where human judgement has overridden the model’s rating, variables were \nexcluded or inputs were altered. These guidelines must include identifying personnel that are responsible \nfor approving these overrides. Banks must identify overrides and separately track their performance.   \n(iv) Data maintenance \n197. A bank must collect and store data on key borrower and facility characteristics to provide effective \nsupport to its internal credit risk measurement and management process, to enable the bank to meet the \nother requirements in this document, and to serve as a basis for supervisory reporting. These data should \nbe sufficiently detailed to allow retrospective re-allocation of obligors and facilities to grades, for example \nif increasing sophistication of the internal rating system suggests that finer segregation of portfolios can \nbe achieved.

For defaulted exposures, banks must retain the data on the pools to which the exposure was \nassigned over the year prior to default and the realised outcomes on LGD and EAD.  \n(v) Stress tests used in assessment of capital adequacy  \n202. An IRB bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the assessment of capital \nadequacy. Stress testing must involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions \nthat could have unfavourable effects on a bank’s credit exposures and assessment of the bank’s ability to \nwithstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are (i) economic or industry downturns; \n(ii) market-risk events; and (iii) liquidity conditions. \n203. In addition to the more general tests described above, the bank must perform a credit risk stress \ntest to assess the effect of cert ain specific conditions on its IRB regulatory capital requirements. The test \nto be employed would be one chosen by the bank, subject to supervisory review. The test to be employed \nmust be meaningful and reasonably conservative. Individual banks may develop  different approaches to \nundertaking this stress test requirement, depending on their circumstances. For this purpose, the objective \nis not to require banks to consider worst -case scenarios. The bank’s stress test in this context should, \nhowever, consider at least the effect of mild recession scenarios. In this case, one example might be to use \ntwo consecutive quarters of zero growth to assess the effect on the bank’s PDs, LGDs and EADs, taking \naccount – on a conservative basis – of the bank’s international diversification. \n204. Whatever method is used, the bank must include a consideration of the following sources of \ninformation. First, a bank’s own data should allow estimation of the ratings migration of at least some of \nits exposures. Second, banks should consider information about the impact of smaller deterioration in the \ncredit environment on a bank’s ratings, giving some information on the likely effect of bigger, stress \ncircumstances. Third, banks should evaluate evidence o f ratings migration in external ratings. This would \ninclude the bank broadly matching its buckets to rating categories. \n205. National supervisors may wish to issue guidance to their banks on how the tests to be used for \nthis purpose should be designed, bearing in mind conditions in their jurisdiction. The results of the stress \ntest may indicate no difference in the capital calculated under the IRB rules described in this section of this \nFramework if the bank already uses such an approach for its internal rating purposes.

In some countries, the board has the main, if not exclusive, function of \nsupervising the executive body (senior management, general management) so as to ensure that the latter fulfils its tasks. For  \nthis reason, in some cases, it is known as a supervisory board. This means that the board has no executive functions. In other \ncountries, by contrast, the board has a broader competence in that it lays down the general framework for the management \nof the bank. Owing to these differences, the notions of the board of directors and senior management are used in this paper \nnot to identify legal constructs but rather to label two decision-making functions within a bank.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 94}

Senior management also must have a good understanding of the rating system’s design and \noperation, and must approve material differences between established procedure and actual practice.  \nManagement must also ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating system is operating properly. \nManagement and staff in the credit control function must meet regularly to discuss the performance of \nthe rating process, areas needing improvement, and the st atus of efforts to improve previously identified \ndeficiencies.  \n208. Internal ratings must be an essential part of the reporting to these parties. Reporting must include \nrisk profile by grade, migration across grades, estimation of the relevant parameters per grade, and \ncomparison of realised default rates (and LGDs and EADs for banks on advanced approaches) against \nexpectations. Reporting frequencies may vary with the significance and type of information and the level \nof the recipient. \n(ii) Credit risk control  \n209. Banks must have independent credit risk control units that are responsible for the design or \nselection, implementation and performance of their internal rating systems. The unit(s) must be \nfunctionally independent from the personnel and manageme nt functions responsible for originating \nexposures. Areas of responsibility must include: \n• Testing and monitoring internal grades; \n• Production and analysis of summary reports from the bank’s rating system, to include historical \ndefault data sorted by rating at the time of default and one year prior to default, grade migration \nanalyses, and monitoring of trends in key rating criteria;  \n• Implementing procedures to verify that rating definitions are consistently applied across \ndepartments and geographic areas;  \n• Reviewing and documenting any changes to the rating process, including the reasons for the \nchanges; and \n• Reviewing the rating criteria to evaluate if they remain predictive of risk. Changes to the rating \nprocess, criteria or individual rating parameters must be documented and retained for supervisors \nto review. \n210. A credit risk control unit must actively participate in the development, selection, implementation \nand validation of rating models. It must assume oversight and supervision  responsibilities for any models \nused in the rating process, and ultimate responsibility for the ongoing review and alterations to rating \nmodels.  \n(iii) Internal and external audit \n211. Internal audit or an equally independent function must review at least annually the bank’s rating \nsystem and its operations, including the operations of the credit function and the estimation of PDs, LGDs \nand EADs. Areas of review include adherence to all applicable minimum requirements. Internal audit must \ndocument its findings.  \n6. Use of internal ratings \n212. Internal ratings and default and loss estimates must play an essential role in the credit approval, \nrisk management, internal capital allocations, and corporate governance functions of banks using the IRB \napproach. Ratings systems and estimates designed and implemented exclusively for the purpose of \nqualifying for the IRB approach and used only to provide IRB inputs are not acceptable. It is recognised \nthat banks will not necessarily be using exactly the same estimates for both IRB and all in ternal purposes.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 95}

Thus, the bank \nmust demonstrate that it has been using a rating system that was broadly in line with the minimum \nrequirements articulated in this document for at least the three years prior to qualification. A bank using \nthe advanced IRB approach must demonstrate that it has been estimating and employing LGDs and EADs \nin a manner that is broadly consistent with the minimum requirements for use of own estimates of LGDs \nand EADs for at least the thr ee years prior to qualification.

Risk quantification \n(i) Overall requirements for estimation \nStructure and intent  \n214. This section addresses the broad standards for own-estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD. Generally, all \nbanks using the IRB approaches must estimate a PD25 for each internal borrower grade for corporate and \nbank exposures or for each pool in the case of retail exposures.  \n215. PD estimates must be a long -run average of one -year default rates for borrowers in the grade, \nwith the exception of retail exposures as set out in paragraph 233 and 234. Requirements specific to PD \nestimation are provided in paragraphs 229 to 234. Banks on the advan ced approach must estimate an \nappropriate LGD (as defined in paragraphs 235 to 240) for each of its facilities (or retail pools). For \nexposures subject to the advanced approach, banks must also estimate an appropriate long -run default-\nweighted average EAD for each of its facilities as defined in paragraphs 241 and 242. Requirements specific \nto EAD estimation appear in paragraphs 241 to 251. For corporate and bank exposures, banks that do not \nmeet the requirements for own-estimates of EAD or LGD, above, must  use the supervisory estimates of \nthese parameters. Standards for use of such estimates are set out in paragraphs 280 to 29 7. \n216. Internal estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD must incorporate all relevant, material and available data, \ninformation and methods. A  bank may utilise internal data and data from external sources (including \npooled data). Where internal or external data is used, the bank must demonstrate that its estimates are \nrepresentative of long run experience. \n217. Estimates must be grounded in hist orical experience and empirical evidence, and not based \npurely on subjective or judgmental considerations. Any changes in lending practice or the process for \npursuing recoveries over the observation period must be taken into account.

Banks must review their estimates on a yearly basis or more frequently.  \n218.

In order \nto avoid over-optimism, a bank must add to its estimates a margin of conservatism that is related to the \nlikely range of errors. Where methods and data are less satisfactory and the likely range of errors is larger, \nthe margin of conse rvatism must be larger. Supervisors may allow some flexibility in application of the \nrequired standards for data that are collected prior to the date of implementation of this Framework. \nHowever, in such cases banks must demonstrate to their supervisors that appropriate adjustments have \nbeen made to achieve broad equivalence to the data without such flexibility. Data collected beyond the \ndate of implementation must conform to the minimum standards unless otherwise stated.  \n(ii) Definition of default \n220. A default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both \nof the two following events have taken place. \n• The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group \nin full, without recourse by the bank to actions such as realising security (if held).  \n• The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking \ngroup.26 Overdrafts will be considered as being past due once the customer has breached an \nadvised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than current outstandings. \n221. The elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include: \n• The bank puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status. \n• The bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a significant perceived \ndecline in credit quality subsequent to the bank taking on the exposure. \n• The bank sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss. \n• The bank consents to a distressed restructuring of the  credit obligation where this is likely to \nresult in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, \nof principal, interest or (where relevant) fees. \n• The bank has filed for the obligor’s bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of the obligor’s credit \nobligation to the banking group. \n• The obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would \navoid or delay repayment of the credit obligation to the banking group. \n222. National supervi sors will provide appropriate guidance as to how these elements must be \nimplemented and monitored. \n223. For retail exposures, the definition of default can be applied at the level of a particular facility, \nrather than at the level of the obligor.

Should the reference definition subsequently be triggered, a seco nd default \nwould be deemed to have occurred. \n(iii) Re- ageing \n226. The bank must have clearly articulated and documented policies in respect of the counting of \ndays past due, in particular in respect of the re -ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, \ndeferrals, renewals and rewrites to existing accounts. At a minimum, the re-ageing policy must include: (a) \napproval authorities and reporting requirements; (b) minimum age of a facility before it is eligible for re-\nageing; (c) delinquency levels  of facilities that are eligible for re -ageing; (d) maximum number of re -\nageings per facility; and (e) a reassessment of the borrower’s capacity to repay. These policies must be \napplied consistently over time, and must support the ‘use test’ (ie if a bank treats a re-aged exposure in a \nsimilar fashion to other delinquent exposures more than the past-due cut off point, this exposure must be \nrecorded as in default for IRB purposes).  \n(iv) Treatment of overdrafts \n227.

Any break of this limit must be monitored; if the account were not brought under \nthe limit after 90 to 180 days (subject to the applicable past -due trigger), it would be considered a s \ndefaulted. Non-authorised overdrafts will be associated with a zero limit for IRB purposes. Thus, days past \ndue commence once any credit is granted to an unauthorised customer; if such credit were not repaid \nwithin 90 to 180 days, the exposure would be considered in default. Banks must have in place rigorous \ninternal policies for assessing the creditworthiness of customers who are offered overdraft accounts.  \n(v) Definition of loss for all asset classes  \n228. The definition of loss used in estimating LGD is economic loss. When measuring economic loss, \nall relevant factors should be taken into account.

This LGD cannot be less than the long-run default-weighted \naverage loss rate given default calculated based on the average economic loss of all observed default s \nwithin the data source for that type of facility. In addition, a bank must take into account the potential for \nthe LGD of the facility to be higher than the default-weighted average during a period when credit losses \nare substantially higher than average . For certain types of exposures, loss severities may not exhibit such \ncyclical variability and LGD estimates may not differ materially from the long -run default -weighted \naverage. However, for other exposures, this cyclical variability in loss severities m ay be important and \nbanks will need to incorporate it into their LGD estimates. For this purpose, banks may make reference to \nthe averages of loss severities observed during periods of high credit losses, forecasts based on \nappropriately conservative assum ptions, or other similar methods. Appropriate estimates of LGD during \nperiods of high credit losses might be formed using either internal and/or external data. Supervisors will \ncontinue to monitor and encourage the development of appropriate approaches to this issue.  \n236. In its analysis, the bank must consider the extent of any dependence between the risk of the \nborrower and that of the collateral or collateral provider. Cases where there is a significant degree of \ndependence must be addressed in a conservative manner. Any currency mismatch between the underlying \nobligation and the collateral must also be considered and treated conservatively in the bank’s assessment \nof LGD.  \n237. LGD estimates must be grounded in historical recovery rates and, when applicable, must not \nsolely be based on the collateral’s estimated market value. This requirement recognises the potential \ninability of banks to gain both control of their collateral and liquidate it expeditiously. To the extent that \nLGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, banks must establish internal requirements for \ncollateral management, operational procedures, legal certainty and risk management process that are \ngenerally consistent with those required for the foundation IRB approach.  \n238.

For on-balance sheet items, banks must estimate EAD at no less \nthan the current drawn amount, subject to recognising the effects of on-balance sheet netting as specified \nin the foundation approach. The minimum requirements for the recognition of netting are the sa me as \nthose under the foundation approach. The additional minimum requirements for internal estimation of \nEAD under the advanced approach, therefore, focus on the estimation of EAD for off- balance sheet items \n(excluding transactions that expose banks to counterparty credit risk as set out in the counterparty credit \nrisk standards). Banks using the advanced approach must have established procedures in place for the \nestimation of EAD for off- balance sheet items. These must specify the estimates of EAD to be used for \neach facility type. Banks’ estimates of EAD should reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the \nborrower up to and after the time a default event is triggered. Where estimates of EAD differ by facility \ntype, the delineation of these facilities must be clear and unambiguous. \n242. Under the advanced approach, banks must assign an estimate of EAD for each eligible facility. It \nmust be an estimate of the long -run default-weighted average EAD for similar facilities and borrowers \nover a sufficiently long period of time, but with a margin of conservatism appropriate to the likely range \nof errors in the estimate. If a positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default \nfrequency and the magnitude of EAD, the EAD estimate must incorporate a larger margin of conservatism. \nMoreover, for exposures for which EAD estimates are volatile over the economic cycle, the bank must use \nEAD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn, if these are more conservative than the \nlong-run average. For banks that have been able to develop their own EAD models, this could be achieved \nby considering the cyclical nature, if any, of the drivers of such models.

Consistent with this principle, EAD est imates applied to particular exposures should not be \nbased on data that comingle the effects of disparate characteristics or data from exposures that exhibit \ndifferent characteristics (eg same broad product grouping but different customers that are managed  \ndifferently by the bank). The estimates should be based on appropriately homogenous segments. \nAlternatively, the estimates should be based on an estimation approach that effectively disentangles the \nimpact of the different characteristics exhibited within the relevant dataset. Practices that generally do not \ncomply with this principle include use of estimates based or partly based on:  \n• SME/midmarket data being applied to large corporate obligors. \n• Data from commitments with ‘small’ unused limit availability being applied to facilities with ‘large’ \nunused limit availability. \n• Data from obligors already identified as problematic at reference date being applied to current \nobligors with no known issues (eg customers at reference date who were already delinquent, \nwatchlisted by the bank, subject to recent bank- initiated limit reductions, blocked from further \ndrawdowns or subject to other types of collections activity). \n• Data that has been affected by changes in obligors’ mix of borrowing and other credit -related \nproducts over the observation period unless that data has been effectively mitigated for such \nchanges, eg by adjusting the data to remove the effects of the changes in the product mix. \nSupervisors should expect banks to demonstrate a detailed understanding of the impact of \nchanges in customer product mix on EAD reference data sets (and associated EAD estimates) and \nthat the impact is immaterial or has been effectively mitigated within each bank’s estimation \nprocess.

Effective \nmitigation would not include: setting floors to CCF/EAD observations; use of obligor -level \nestimates that do not fully cover the relevant product transformation options or inappropriately \ncombine products with very different characteristics (eg revolving and non -revolving products); \nadjusting only ‘material’ observations affected by product transformation; generally excluding \nobservations affected by product profile transformation (thereby potentially distorting the  \nrepresentativeness of the remaining data). \n247.

Alternatively, banks may choose to not recognise the \neffect of guarantees on their exposures. \nEligible guarantors and guarantees \n256. There are no restrictions on the types of eligible guarantors. The bank must, however, have clearly \nspecified criteria for the types of guarantors it will recognise for regulatory capital purposes.  \n257. The guarantee must be evidenced in writing, non- cancellable on the part of th e guarantor, in \nforce until the debt is satisfied in full (to the extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee) and legally \nenforceable against the guarantor in a jurisdiction where the guarantor has assets to attach and enforce a \njudgement. The guarantee must also be unconditional; there should be no clause in the protection contract \noutside the direct control of the bank that could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to \npay out in a timely manner in the event that the original counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due. \nHowever, as an exception for the purposes of own estimates of EAD under the A-IRB, guarantees that only \ncover loss remaining after the bank has first pursued the original obligor for payment and has completed \nthe workout process may be recognised. \n258.

The purchasing bank will be required to group the receivables into sufficiently homogeneous \npools so that accurate and consistent estimates of PD and LGD (or EL) for default losses and EL estimates \nof dilution losses can be determined. In general, the risk bucketing process will reflect the seller’s \nunderwriting practices and the heterogeneity of its customers. In addition, methods and data for \nestimating PD, LGD, and EL must comply with the existing risk quantification standards for retail exposures. \nIn particular, quantification should reflect all information available to the purchasing bank regarding the \nquality of the underlying receivables, including data for similar pools provided by the seller, by the \npurchasing bank, or by external sources.

The analysis must be based on data that are appropriate to the portfolio, are updated \nregularly, and cover a relevant observation period. Banks’ internal assessments of the performance of their \nown rating systems must be based on long data histories, covering a range of economic conditions, and \nideally one or more complete business cycles. \n277. Banks must demonstrate that quantitative testing methods and other validation methods do not \nvary systematically with the economic cycle. Changes in methods and data (both data sources and periods \ncovered) must be clearly and thoroughly documented. \n278. Banks must have well -articulated internal standards for situations where deviations in realised \nPDs, LGDs and EADs from expectations become significant enough to call the validity of the estimates into \nquestion. These standards must take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in default \nexperiences.

Eligible CRE and RRE collateral for corporate and bank exposures are defined as:  \n• Collateral where the risk of the borrower is not materially dependent upon the performance of \nthe underlying property or project, but rather on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay \nthe debt from other sources. As such, repayment of the facility is not materially dependent on \nany cash flow generated by the underlying CRE/RRE serving as collateral;\n29 and  \n• Additionally, the value of the collateral pledged must not be materially dependent on the \nperformance of the borrower. This requirement is not intended to preclude situations where \npurely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the collateral and the performance of the \nborrower. \n282. In light of the generic description above and the definition of corporate exposures, income \nproducing real estate that falls under the SL asset class is specifically excluded from recognition as \ncollateral for corporate exposures.\n30  \n(ii) Operational requirements for eligible CRE/RRE \n283. Subject to meeting the definition above, CRE and RRE will be eligible for recognition as collateral \nfor corporate claims only if all of the following operational requirements are met.  \n• Legal enfor ceability: any claim on collateral taken must be legally enforceable in all relevant \njurisdictions, and any claim on collateral must be properly filed on a timely basis. Collateral \ninterests must reflect a perfected lien (ie all legal requirements for establishing the claim have \nbeen fulfilled). Furthermore, the collateral agreement and the legal process underpinning it must \nbe such that they provide for the bank to realise the value of the collateral within a reasonable \ntimeframe. \n• Objective market value of collateral: the collateral must be valued at or less than the current fair \nvalue under which the property could be sold under private contract between a willing seller and \nan arm’s-length buyer on the date of valuation.  \n \n29  The Committee recognises that in some countries where multifamily housing makes up an important part of the housing market \nand where public policy is supportive of that sector, including specially established public sector companies as major providers, \nthe risk characteristics of lending secured by mortgage on such residential real estate can be similar to those of traditional \ncorporate exposures. The national supervisor may under such circumstances recognise mortgage on multifamily residential \nreal estate as eligible collateral for corporate exposures. \n30  In exceptional circumstance s for well -developed and long -established markets, mortgages on office and/or multi- purpose \ncommercial premises and/or multi-tenanted commercial premises may have the potential to receive recognition as collateral \nin the corporate portfolio.

More frequent monitoring is suggested where the \nmarket is subject to significant changes in conditions. Statistical methods of evaluation (eg \nreference to  house price indices, sampling) may be used to update estimates or to identify \ncollateral that may have declined in value and that may need re-appraisal. A qualified professional \nmust evaluate the property when information indicates that the value of the c ollateral may have \ndeclined materially relative to general market prices or when a credit event, such as default, \noccurs.  \n• Junior liens: In some member countries, eligible collateral will be restricted to situations where \nthe lender has a first charge over  the property.\n31 Junior liens may be taken into account where \nthere is no doubt that the claim for collateral is legally enforceable and constitutes an efficient \ncredit risk mitigant. Where junior liens are recognised the bank must first take the haircut va lue \nof the collateral, then reduce it by the sum of all loans with liens that rank higher than the junior \nlien, the remaining value is the collateral that supports the loan with the junior lien. In cases where \nliens are held by third parties that rank pari  passu with the lien of the bank, only the proportion \nof the collateral (after the application of haircuts and reductions due to the value of loans with \nliens that rank higher than the lien of the bank) that is attributable to the bank may be recognised.  \n284. Additional collateral management requirements are as follows: \n• The types of CRE and RRE collateral accepted by the bank and lending policies (advance rates) \nwhen this type of collateral is taken must be clearly documented. \n• The bank must take steps to ensure that the property taken as collateral is adequately insured \nagainst damage or deterioration. \n• The bank must monitor on an ongoing basis the extent of any permissible prior claims (eg tax) \non the property.  \n• The bank must appropriately monitor the risk of environmental liability arising in respect of the \ncollateral, such as the presence of toxic material on a property. \n(iii) Requirements for recognition of financial receivables \nDefinition of eligible receivables \n285. Eligible financial receivables are claims with an original maturity of less than or equal to one year \nwhere repayment will occur through the commercial or financial flows related to the underlying assets of \nthe borrower. This includes both self- liquidating debt arising from the sale of goods or services linked to \na commercial transaction and general amounts owed by buyers, suppliers, renters, national and local \ngovernmental authorities, or other non-affiliated parties not related to the sale of goods or services linked \nto a commercial transaction. Eligible receivables do not include those associated with securitisations, sub-\nparticipations or credit derivatives. \nOperational requirements  \nLegal certainty \n286. The legal mechanism by which collateral is given must be robust and ensure that the lender has \nclear rights over the proceeds from the collateral.  \n \n31  In some of these jurisdictions, first liens are subject to the prior right of preferential creditors, such as outstanding tax claims \nand employees’ wages.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 109}

All documentation used in collateralised transactions must be binding on all parties and legally \nenforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. B anks must have conducted sufficient legal review to verify this \nand have a well -founded legal basis to reach this conclusion, and undertake such further review as \nnecessary to ensure continuing enforceability. \n289. The collateral arrangements must be prope rly documented, with a clear and robust procedure \nfor the timely collection of collateral proceeds. Banks’ procedures should ensure that any legal conditions \nrequired for declaring the default of the customer and timely collection of collateral are observe d. In the \nevent of the obligor’s financial distress or default, the bank should have legal authority to sell or assign \nthe receivables to other parties without consent of the receivables’ obligors.  \nRisk management \n290. The bank must have a sound process f or determining the credit risk in the receivables. Such a \nprocess should include, among other things, analyses of the borrower’s business and industry (eg effects \nof the business cycle) and the types of customers with whom the borrower does business. Where the bank \nrelies on the borrower to ascertain the credit risk of the customers, the bank must review the borrower’s \ncredit policy to ascertain its soundness and credibility.  \n291. The margin between the amount of the exposure and the value of the receivables must reflect all \nappropriate factors, including the cost of collection, concentration within the receivables pool pledged by \nan individual borrower, and potential concentration risk within the bank’s total exposures.  \n292. The bank must maintain a conti nuous monitoring process that is appropriate for the specific \nexposures (either immediate or contingent) attributable to the collateral to be utilised as a risk mitigant. \nThis process may include, as appropriate and relevant, ageing reports, control of trade documents, \nborrowing base certificates, frequent audits of collateral, confirmation of accounts, control of the proceeds \nof accounts paid, analyses of dilution (credits given by the borrower to the issuers) and regular financial \nanalysis of both the borrower and the issuers of the receivables, especially in the case when a small number \nof large-sized receivables are taken as collateral.

{"text": "Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms 109 \n \n \nMinimum capital requirements for CVA risk  \nA. General provisions \n1. In the context of this document, CVA stands for credit valuation adjustment specified at a \ncounterparty level. CVA reflects the adjustment of default risk -free prices of derivatives and securities  \nfinancing transactions (SFTs) as defined in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Annex 4 of the Basel II framework 1 due \nto a potential default of the counterparty. Regulatory CVA may differ from CVA used for accounting \npurposes as follows: (i) regulatory CVA excludes the effect of the bank’s own default; (ii) several constraints \nreflecting best practice in accounting CVA are imposed on calculations of regulatory CVA, so some banks \nmay find that regulatory CVA deviates from their accounting CVA. Unless explicitly specifie d otherwise, \nthe term “CVA” in this document means “regulatory CVA”. \n2. CVA risk is defined as the risk of losses arising from changing CVA values in response to changes \nin counterparty credit spreads and market risk factors that drive prices of derivative transactions and SFTs.  \n3. The capital requirement for CVA risk must be calculated by all banks involved in covered \ntransactions. Covered transactions include all derivatives except those transacted directly with  a qualified \ncentral counterparty. Furthermore, covered transactions also include SFTs that are fair -valued by a bank \nfor accounting purposes.  \n4. The CVA risk capital requirement is calculated for a bank’s “CVA portfolio” on a standalone basis. \nThe CVA portfolio includes CVA for a bank’s entire po rtfolio of covered transactions and eligible CVA \nhedges.  \n5. Two approaches are available for calculating CVA capital: the standardised approach (SA -CVA) \nand the basic approach (BA -CVA). Banks must use the BA -CVA unless they receive approval from their \nrelevant supervisory authority to use the SA-CVA.\n2  \n6. Banks that have received approval of their supervisory authority to use the SA -CVA may carve \nout from the SA-CVA calculations any number of netting sets. CVA capital for all carved out netting sets \nmust be calculated via the BA-CVA.  \n7. A materiality threshold is established. Any bank whose aggregate notional amount of non-\ncentrally cleared derivatives is less than or equal to 100 billion euro is deemed as being below the \nmateriality threshold. Any bank below the materiality threshold may choose to set its CVA capital equal to \n100% of the bank’s capital requirement for counterparty credit risk (CCR). CVA hedges are not recognised \nunder this treatment. If chosen, this treatment must be applied to the bank’s entire portfolio instead of \nthe BA-CVA or the SA-CVA. A bank’s relevant supervisory authority, however, can remove this option if it \ndetermines that CVA risk resulting from the bank’s derivative positions materially contributes to the bank’s \noverall risk.  \n8.

Basic Approach for CVA \n1. General provisions \n11. The BA-CVA calculations may be performed either via the reduced version or the full version. The \nfull version recognises counterparty spread hedges and is intended for banks that hedge CVA risk. The \nreduced version is obtained from the full version via elimination of hedging recognition. The reduced \nversion is design ed to simplify BA -CVA implementation for less sophisticated banks that do not hedge \nCVA. The reduced BA -CVA is also part of the full BA -CVA capital calculations as a conservative means to \nrestrict hedging efficiency, so all banks using the BA -CVA must make these calculations. Any bank under \nthe BA-CVA approach can choose whether to implement the full version or the reduced version.  \n2. Reduced version of the BA-CVA (hedges are not recognised) \n12.

The minimum criteria for the SA-CVA eligibility include the following: \n• A bank must be able to model exposure and calculate, on at least a monthly basis, CVA and CVA \nsensitivities to the market risk factors specified in Section C.6 of this framework.  \n• A bank must have a CVA desk (or a similar dedicated function) responsible for risk management \nand hedging of CVA. \n2. Regulatory CVA calculations \n29. Regulatory CVA is the base for the calculation of the CVA risk capital requirement under the SA -\nCVA. Calculations of regulatory CVA must be performed for each counterparty with which a bank has at \nleast one covered position.  \n30. Regulatory CVA at a counterparty level must be calculated according to the following principles, \nwith the bank’s adherence to the principles to be demonstrated by the bank to its relevant supervisor:  \n• Regulatory CVA must be calculated as the expectation of future losses resulting f rom default of \nthe counterparty under the assumption that the bank itself is default risk-free.  \n• The calculation must be based on at least the following inputs: (i) term structure of market -\nimplied probability of default (PD); (ii) market -consensus expected loss given default (ELGD); (3) \nsimulated paths of discounted future exposure.  \n• The term structure of market-implied PD must be estimated from credit spreads observed in the \nmarkets. For counterparties whose credit is not actively traded (ie illiquid coun terparties), the \nmarket-implied PD must be estimated from proxy credit spreads estimated for these \ncounterparties according to the following requirements: \n− A bank must estimate the credit spread curves of illiquid counterparties from credit spreads \nobserved in the markets of the counterparty’s liquid peers via an algorithm that discriminates \non at least three variables: a measure of credit quality (eg rating), industry, and region. \n− In certain cases, mapping an illiquid counterparty to a single liquid referen ce name can be \nallowed. A typical example would be mapping a municipality to its home country (ie setting \nthe municipality credit spread equal to the sovereign credit spread plus a premium). A bank \nmust justify to its supervisor every case of mapping to single names. \n− When no credit spreads of any of the counterparty’s peers is available due to the \ncounterparty’s specific type (eg project finance, funds), a bank is allowed to use a more \nfundamental analysis of credit risk to proxy the spread of an illiquid c ounterparty. However, \nwhere historical PDs are used as part of this assessment, the resulting spread cannot be \nbased on historical PD only – it must relate to credit markets. \n• The market-consensus ELGD value used for regulatory CVA calculation must be the same as the \none used to calculate the risk- neutral PD from credit spreads unless the bank can demonstrate \nthat the seniority of the derivative exposure differs from the seniority of senior unsecured bonds. \nCollateral provided by the counterparty does not change the seniority of the derivative exposure. \n• The paths of discounted future exposure are produced via pricing of all derivative transactions \nwith the counterparty on simulated paths of relevant market risk factors and discounting the \nprices to today using risk", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 119}

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal \nprocesses, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, 1 but excludes \nstrategic and reputational risk. \n2.  The standardised approach for measuring minimum operational risk capital requirements \nreplaces all existing approaches in the Basel II framework. 2 That is, this standard replaces paragraphs 644 \nto 683 of the Basel II framework. \n3. Consistent with Part I (Scope of Application) of the Basel II Framework, the standardised approach \napplies to internationally active banks on a consolidated basis. Supervisors retain the discretion to apply \nthe standardised approach framework to non-internationally active banks.  \n2.  The standardised approach  \n4. The standardised approach methodology is based on the following components: (i) the Business \nIndicator (BI) which  is a financial -statement-based proxy for operational risk; (ii) the Business Indicator \nComponent (BIC), which is calculated by multiplying the BI by a set of regulatory determined marginal \ncoefficients (αi); and (iii) the Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM), which is a scaling factor that is based on a bank’s \naverage historical losses and the BIC.  \nThe Business Indicator  \n5. The Business Indicator (BI) comprises three components: the interest, leases and dividend \ncomponent (ILDC); the services component (SC), and the financial component (FC).  \n6.

The definitions for each of the components of the BI are provided in the annex of this section.  \nThe Business Indicator Component \n8. To calculate the BIC, the BI is multiplied by the marginal coefficients (αi). The marginal coefficients \nincrease with the size of the BI as shown in Table 1. For banks in the first bucket (ie with a BI less than or \nequal to €1bn) the BIC is equal to BI x 12%. The marginal increase in the BIC resulting from a one unit \nincrease in the BI is 12% in bucket 1, 15% in bucket 2 and 18% in bucket 3. For example, given a BI = \n€35bn, the BIC = (1 x 12%) + (30-1) x 15% + (35-30) x 18% = €5.37bn. \nBI ranges and marginal coefficients Table 1 \nBucket BI range (in €bn) BI marginal coefficients (αi) \n1 ≤1  12% \n2 1 < BI ≤30 15% \n3 > 30 18% \nThe Internal Loss Multiplier  \n9.

The ILM is  equal to one where the loss and business indicator components are \nequal. Where the LC is greater than the BIC, the ILM is greater than one. That is, a bank with losses that \nare high relative to its BIC is required to hold higher capital due to the incorporation of internal losses into \nthe calculation methodology. Conversely, where the LC is lower than the BIC, the ILM is less than one. That \nis, a bank with losses that are low relative to its BIC is required to hold lower capital due to the \nincorporation of internal losses into the calculation methodology. \n10.

At national discretion, supervisors may allow the inclusion of internal loss data into the framework \nfor banks in bucket 1, subject to meeting the loss data collection requirements specified in paragraphs 19 \nto 31.

At the consolidated level, the standardised approach calculations use fully consolidated BI figures, \nwhich net all the intragroup income and expenses.

The calculations at the subsidiary level use \nthe BI figures from the subsidiary. \n15. Similar to bank holding companies, when BI figures for sub- consolidated or subsidiary banks \nreach bucket 2, these banks are required to use loss experience in the standardised approach calculations. \nA sub-consolidated bank or a subsidiary bank uses only the losses it has incurred in the standardised \napproach calculations (and does not include losses incurred by other parts of the bank holding company). \n16.

In such cases supervisors may require the bank to apply an ILM which is greater \nthan 1.

Building an acceptable loss data set from the available internal data requires that the bank \ndevelop policies and procedures to address several features, including gross loss definition, reference date \nand grouped losses. \nGross loss, net loss, and recovery definitions \n21. Gross loss is a loss before recoveries of any type. Net loss is defined as the loss after taking into \naccount the impact of recoveries. The recovery is an independent occurrence, related to the original loss \nevent, separate in time, in which funds or inflows of economic benefits are received from a third party. 7 \n22. Banks must be able to identify the gross loss amounts, non -insurance recoveries, and insurance \nrecoveries for all operational loss events. Banks should use losses net of recoveries (including insurance \nrecoveries) in the loss dataset. However, recoveries can be used to reduce losses only after the bank \nreceives payment. Receivables do not count as recoveries. Verification of payments received to net losses \nmust be provided to supervisors upon request. \n23.

To reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets and to enhance the comparability of risk-\nweighted capital ratios, banks will be subject to a floor requirement that is applied to risk-weighted assets. \nThe output floor will ensure that banks’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of \ncapital requirements derived under standardised approaches. \nOutput floor requirements \n2. As set out in the Basel III framework, banks must meet the following capital requirements:  \n• Common Equity Tier 1 must be at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets at all times. \n• Tier 1 capital must be at least 6.0% of risk-weighted assets at all times. \n• Total Capital (Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital) must be at least 8.0% of risk-weighted assets at all \ntimes.1 \n3. In addition, a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer is set at 2.5% of risk -weighted \nassets for all banks. 2 Banks may also be subject to a countercyclical capital buffer requirement. Banks \nidentified as global systemically- important banks (G -SIBs) are also subject to additional higher -loss \nabsorbency requirements and total loss-absorbing capacity requirements.3  \n4. The risk-weighted assets that banks must use to determine compliance with the requirements set \nout in paragraphs 2 to 3 above must be calculated as the maximum of: (i) the total risk -weighted assets \ncalculated using the approaches that the bank has supervisory approval to use in accordance with the \nBasel capital framework (including both standardised and internally-modelled based approaches); and (ii) \n72.5% of the total risk weighted assets , calculated using only the standardised approaches listed in \nparagraph 6.

{"text": "140 Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms \n \n \nLeverage ratio \nIntroduction  \n1. An underlying cause of the global financial crisis was the build -up of excessive on - and off-\nbalance sheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive leverage while \nreporting strong risk-based capital ratios. At the height of the crisis, financial markets forced the banking \nsector to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressures on asset prices. This \ndeleveraging process exacerbated the feedback loop between losses, falling bank capital and contracting \ncredit availability.  \n2. The Basel III framework introduced a simple, transparent, non-risk-based leverage ratio to act as \na credible supplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirements.1 The leverage ratio is intended \nto: \n• restrict the build -up of leverage in the banking sector to avoid destabilising deleveraging \nprocesses that can damage the broader financial system and the economy; and \n• reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, non-risk-based “backstop” measure.  \n3. The Committee is of the view that a simple leverage ratio framework is critical and complementary \nto the risk-based capital framework, and that the leverage ratio should adequately capture both the on - \nand off-balance sheet sources of banks’ leverage.  \nDefinition and requirements \n4. The leverage ratio is defined as the capital measure (the numerator) divided by the exposure \nmeasure (the denominator), with this ratio expressed as a percentage: \nLeverage ratio = Capital measure\nExposure measure  \n5. The capital measure for the leverage ratio is Tier 1 capital – comprising Common Equity Tier 1 \nand/or Additional Tier 1 instruments – as defined in paragraphs 49 to 96 of the Basel III framework.  In \nother words, the capital measure used for the leverage ratio at any particular point in time is the Tier 1 \ncapital measure applicable at that time under the risk -based framework. The exposure measure for the \nleverage ratio is defined in paragraphs 20 to 59 of this section. \n6. Both the capital measure and the exposure measure are to be calculated on a quarter-end basis. \nHowever, banks may, subject to supervisory approval, use more frequent calculations (eg daily or monthly \naveraging) as long as they do so consistently. \n7. Banks must meet a 3% leverage ratio minimum requirement at all times. \n8.  In addition, to maintain the relative roles of the risk -weighted and leverage ratio requirements, \nbanks identified as global systemically- important banks (G-SIBs) according the G-SIB standard must also \nmeet a leverage ratio buffer requirement.\n2 Consistent with the capital measure required to meet the \n \n1  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, \nJune 2011, www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf. \n2  See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Global systemically important banks: updated assessment methodology and the \nhigher loss absorbency requirement, July 2013, www.bis.org/publ/bcbs255.pdf.", "source": "d424.pdf", "page": 144}
{"text": "Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms 141 \n \n \nleverage ratio minimum described in paragraph 5, G-SIBs must meet the leverage ratio buffer with Tier 1 \ncapital.  \n9.  The leverage ratio buffer will be set at 50% of a G -SIB’s higher-loss absorbency risk- weighted \nrequirements. For example, a G-SIB subject to a 2% higher-loss absorbency requirement would be subject \nto a 1% leverage ratio buffer requirement.  \n10. The design of the leverage ratio buffer is aki n to the capital buffers in the risk -weighted \nframework. As such, the leverage ratio buffer will include minimum capital conservation ratios divided in \nfive ranges. Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on a G -SIB which does not meet its leverag e \nratio buffer requirement.  \n11. The capital distribution constraints imposed on G- SIBs will depend on the G -SIB’s CET1 risk -\nweighted ratio and its leverage ratio. A G -SIB which meets both its CET1 risk -weighted requirements \n(defined as a 4.5% minimum requirement, a 2.5% capital conservation buffer , the G -SIB higher loss -\nabsorbency requirement  and countercyclical capital buffer if applicable) and its Tier 1 leverage ratio \nrequirement (defined as a 3% leverage ratio minimum requirement and the G -SIB leverage ratio buffer) \nwill not be subject to minimum capital conservation standards. A G-SIB which does not meet one of these \nrequirements will be subject to the associated minimum capital conservation standards. A G -SIB which \ndoes not meet both requirements will be subject to the higher minimum capital conservation standard \nrelated to its risk-weighted capital requirement or leverage ratio. \n12. As an example, the table below shows the minimum capital conservation standards for the CET1 \nrisk-weighted requirements and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements of a G -SIB in the first bucket of the \nhigher loss-absorbency requirements (ie where a 1% risk-weighted G-SIB capital buffer applies).  \nCET1 risk-weighted ratio Tier 1 leverage ratio Minimum capital conservation ratios (expressed \nas a percentage of earnings) \n4.5%–5.375% 3%–3.125% 100% \n> 5.375%–6.25% > 3.125%–3.25% 80% \n> 6.25%–7.125% > 3.25%–3.375% 60% \n> 7.125%–8% > 3.375%–3.50% 40% \n> 8.0% > 3.50% 0% \n \nImplementation and monitoring \n13.

Unless specified differently below, banks must not take account of physical or financial collateral, \nguarantees or other credit risk mitigation techniques to reduce the leverage ratio exposure measure, nor \nmay banks net assets and liabilities. \n22. To ensure consistency, any item deducted from Tier 1 capital according to the Basel III framework \nand regulatory adjustments other than those related to liabilities may be deducted from the leverage ratio \nexposure measure. Three examples follow:  \n• where a banking, financial or insurance entity is not included in the regulatory scope of \nconsolidation as set out in paragraph 18, the amount of any investment in the capital of that \nentity that is totally or partially deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital or from \nAdditional Tier 1 capital of the bank following the corresponding deduction approach  in \nparagraphs 84 to 89 of the Basel III framework may also be deducted from the leverage ratio \nexposure measure; \n• for banks using the internal ratings -based (IRB) approach to determining capital requirements \nfor credit risk, paragraph 73 of the Basel III framework requires any shortfall in the stock of eligible \nprovisions relative to expected loss amounts to be deducted from CET1 capital. The same amount \nmay be deducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure; and \n• prudent valuation adjustments (PVAs) for exposures to less liquid positions, other than those \nrelated to liabilities, that are deducted from Tier 1 capital as per paragraph 718 (cxii) of the Basel II \nframework as amended by the standard Minimum capital requirements for market risk\n7 (hereafter \n“market risk framework”) may be deducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure.  \n23. Liability items must not be deducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure. For example, \ngains/losses on fair valued liabilities or accounting value adjustments on derivative liabilities due to \nchanges in the bank’s own credit risk as described in paragraph 75 of the Basel III framework must not be \ndeducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure. \n24. With regard to traditional securitisations, an originating bank may exclude securitised exposures \nfrom its leverage ratio exposure measure if the securitisation meets the operational requirements for the \nrecognition of risk transfer ence according to paragraph 24 of the standard Revisions to the securitisation \nframework.\n8 Banks meeting these conditions must include any retained securitisation exposures in their \nleverage ratio exposure measure.

Cash pooling refers to arrangements involving treasury products whereby a bank combines the \ncredit and/or debit balances of several individual participating customer accounts into a single account \nbalance to facilitate cash and/or liquidity management. For purposes of the leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure, where a cash pooling arrangement entails a transfer at least on a daily basis of the credit and/or \ndebit balances of the individual participating customer accounts into a single account balance, the \nindividual participating customer accounts are deemed to be extinguished and transformed into a single \naccount balance upon the transfer provided the bank is not liable for the balances on an individual basis \nupon the transfer. Thus, the basis of the leverage ratio exposure measure for such a cash pooling \narrangement is the single account balance and not the individual participating custome r accounts.

Banks must calculate their exposures associated with all derivative transactions, including where \na bank sells protection using a credit derivative, as a scalar multiplier alpha set at 1.4 times the sum of the \nRC14 and the PFE, as described in paragraph 34. If the derivative exposure is covered by an eligible bilateral \nnetting contract as specified in the Annex, a specific treatment may be applied.15 Written credit derivatives \nare subject to an additional treatment, as set out in paragraphs 44 to 49 below. \n34. For derivative transactions not covered by an eligible bilateral netting contract as specified in \nparagraphs 4 and 5 of the Annex, the amount to be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure is \ndetermined, for each transaction separately, as follows: \nexposure measure = alpha * (RC + PFE) \nwhere \n• alpha = 1.4; \n• RC = the replacement cost calculated according to paragraph 2 of the Annex; and  \n• PFE = an amount for PFE calculated according to paragraph 3 of the Annex. \n35. Bilateral netting : wh en an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place as specified in  \nparagraphs 4 and 5 of the Annex, the formula in paragraph 34 is applied at the netting set level as \ndescribed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Annex.  \n36. Treatment of related collateral: collateral received in connection with derivative contracts has two \ncountervailing effects on leverage: \n• it reduces counterparty exposure; but \n• it can also increase the economic resources at the disposal of the bank, as the bank can use the \ncollateral to leverage itself. \n37. C ollateral received  in connection with derivative contracts does not necessarily reduce the \nleverage inherent in a bank’s derivative position, which is generally the case if the settlement exposure \narising from the underlying derivative contract is not reduced. As a general principle of the Basel III \nleverage ratio framework, collateral received may not be netted against derivative exposures whether or \nnot netting is permitted under the bank’s operative accounting or risk -based framework. Hence, when \ncalculating the exposure amount by applying paragraphs 33 to 35 above, a bank must not reduce the \nleverage ratio exposure measure amount by any collateral received from the counterparty. This implies \nthat the RC cannot be reduced by collateral received and that the multiplier referenced in paragraph 3 of \n \n14  If, under a bank’s national accounting standards, there is no accounting measure of exposure for certain derivative instruments \nbecause they are held (completely) off balance sheet, the bank must use the sum of positive fair values of these derivatives as \nthe replacement cost. \n15  These are netting rules of the Basel II framework excepting the rules for cross -product netting in Annex 4, Section III  \n(ie netting across product categories such as derivatives and SFTs is not permitted in determining the leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure).

Similarly, with regard to collateral provided, banks must gross up their leverage ratio exposure \nmeasure by the amount of any derivatives collateral provided where the provision of that collateral has \nreduced the value of their balance sheet assets under their operative accounting framework.  \n39. Treatment of cash variation margin : in the treatment of derivative exposures for the purpose of \nthe leverage ratio exposure measure, the cash portion of variation margin exchanged between \ncounterparties may be viewed as a form of pre-settlement payment if the following conditions are met: \n(i) For trades not cleared through a qualifying central counterparty (QCCP)\n16 the cash received by \nthe recipient counterparty is not segregated. Cash variation margin would satisfy the non -\nsegregation criterion if the recipient counterparty has no restrictions by law, regulation, or any \nagreement with the counterparty on the ability to use the cash received (ie the cash variation \nmargin received is used as its own cash). \n(ii) Variation margin is calculated and exchanged on at least a daily basis based on mark- to-market \nvaluation of derivative positions.\n To meet this criterion, derivative positions must be valued daily \nand cash variation margin must be transferred at least daily to the counterparty or to the \ncounterparty’s account, as appropriate. Cash variation margin exchanged on the morning of the \nsubsequent trading day based on the previous, end -of-day market values would meet this \ncriterion. \n(iii) The variation margin is received in a currency specified in the derivative cont ract, governing \nmaster netting agreement (MNA), credit support annex (CSA) to the qualifying MNA or as defined \nby any netting agreement with a CCP. \n(iv) Variation margin exchanged is the full amount that would be necessary to extinguish the mark -\nto-market exposure of the derivative subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts \napplicable to the counterparty.\n17  \n(v) Derivative transactions and variation margins are covered by a single MNA between the legal \nentities that are the counterparties in the derivative transaction.

Where a client enters directly into a derivative transaction with the CCP and the CM guarantees \nthe performance of its client’s derivative trade exposures to the CCP, the bank acting as the CM for the \nclient to the CCP must calculate its related leverage ratio exposure resulting from the guarantee as a \nderivative exposure as set out in paragraphs 33 to 40, as if it had entered directly into the transaction with \nthe client, including with regard to the receipt or provision of cash variation margin. \n43. For the purposes of paragraphs 41 and 42, an entity affiliated to the bank acting as a CM may be \nconsidered a client if it is outside the relevant scope of regulatory consolidation at the level at which the \nleverage ratio is applied. In contrast, if an affiliate entity falls within the regulatory scope of consolidation, \nthe trade between the affiliate entity and the CM is eliminated in the course of consolidation but the CM \nstill has a trade exposure to the CCP. In this case, the transaction with the CCP will be considered \nproprietary and the exemption in paragraph 41 will not apply. \n44. Additional treatment for written cred it derivatives: in addition to the CCR exposure arising from \nthe fair value of the contracts, written credit derivatives create a notional credit exposure arising from the \ncreditworthiness of the reference entity. The Committee therefore believes that it i s appropriate to treat \nwritten credit derivatives consistently with cash instruments (eg loans, bonds) for the purposes of the \nleverage ratio exposure measure. \n45. In order to capture the credit exposure to the underlying reference entity, in addition to the above \ntreatment for derivatives and related collateral, the effective notional amount referenced by a written credit \nderivative is to be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure unless the written credit derivative is \nincluded in a transaction cleared on the behalf of a client of the bank acting as a CM (or acting as a clearing \nservices provider in a multi-level client structure as referenced in paragraph 41) and the transaction meets \nthe requirements of paragraph 41 for the exclusion of trade exposures to the QCCP (or, in the case of a \nmulti-level client structure, the requirements of paragraph 41 for the exclusion of trade exposures to the \nCM or the QCCP). The “effective notional amount” is obtained by adjusting the notional amount to reflect \nthe true exposure of contracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the \ntransaction.

Mathematically: \naggregatePFE multiplier AddOn= ⋅   \nFor the purposes of the leverage ratio framework, the multiplier is fixed at one. Moreover, when \ncalculating the add-on component, for all margined transactions the maturity factor set out in paragraph \n164 of Annex 4 of the SA-CCR framework may be used. Further, as written options create an exposure to \nthe underlying, they must be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure by applying the treatment \ndescribed in this Annex, even if certain written options are permitted t he zero exposure at default (EAD) \ntreatment allowed in the risk-based framework. \nBilateral netting \n4.  For the purposes of the leverage ratio exposure measure, the following will apply: \n(a) Banks may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between a bank and \nits counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated \nwith all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting one single \namount for the previous gross obligations.  \n \n35  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, The standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures , March \n2014 (rev.

{"text": "IFRS 9\nFinancial Instruments\nIn April 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (Board) adopted\nIAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement , which had originally been issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Committee in March 1999.\nThe Board had always intended that IFRS 9 Financial Instruments would replace IAS 39 in\nits entirety. However, in response to requests from interested parties that the accounting\nfor financial instruments should be improved quickly, the Board divided its project to\nreplace IAS 39 into three main phases. As the Board completed each phase, it issued\nchapters in IFRS 9 that replaced the corresponding requirements in IAS 39.\nIn November 2009 the Board issued the chapters of IFRS 9 relating to the classification\nand measurement of financial assets. In October 2010 the Board added the requirements\nrelated to the classification and measurement of financial liabilities to IFRS 9. This\nincludes requirements on embedded derivatives and how to account for changes in own\ncredit risk on financial liabilities designated under the fair value option.\nIn October 2010 the Board also decided to carry forward unchanged from IAS 39 the\nrequirements related to the derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.\nBecause of these changes, in October 2010 the Board restructured IFRS 9 and its Basis for\nConclusions. In December 2011 the Board deferred the mandatory effective date of\nIFRS 9.\nIn November 2013 the Board added a Hedge Accounting chapter. IFRS 9 permits an entity\nto choose as its accounting policy either to apply the hedge accounting requirements of\nIFRS 9 or to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39.\nConsequently, although IFRS 9 is effective (with limited exceptions for entities that issue\ninsurance contracts and entities applying the IFRS for SMEs Standard), IAS 39, which now\ncontains only its requirements for hedge accounting, also remains effective.\nIn July 2014 the Board issued the completed version of IFRS 9. The Board made limited\namendments to the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets by\naddressing a narrow range of application questions and by introducing a ‘fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income’ measurement category for particular simple debt\ninstruments. The Board also added the impairment requirements relating to the\naccounting for an entity’s expected credit losses on its financial assets and commitments\nto extend credit. A new mandatory effective date was also set.\nIn May 2017 when IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts was issued, it amended the derecognition\nrequirements in IFRS 9 by permitting an exemption for when an entity repurchases its\nfinancial liability in specific circumstances.\nIn October 2017 IFRS 9 was amended by Prepayment Features with Negative\nCompensation (Amendments to IFRS 9). The amendments specify that particular financial\nassets with prepayment features that may result in reasonable negative compensation for\nthe early termination of such contracts are eligible to be measured at amortised cost or at\nfair value through other comprehensive income.\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A363", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 1}

Interest Rate\nBenchmark Reform also amended IFRS 7 to add specific disclosure requirements for hedging\nrelationships to which an entity applies the exceptions in IFRS 9 or IAS 39.\nIn August 2020 the Board issued Interest Rate Benchmark Reform ―Phase 2 which amended\nrequirements in IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to:\n• changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets,\nfinancial liabilities and lease liabilities;\n• hedge accounting; and\n• disclosures.\nThe Phase 2 amendments apply only to changes required by the interest rate benchmark\nreform to financial instruments and hedging relationships.\nOther Standards have made minor consequential amendments to IFRS 9.

When an entity first recognises a financial\nasset, it shall classify it in accordance with paragraphs 4.1.1 –4.1.5 and\nmeasure it in accordance with paragraphs 5.1.1 –5.1.3. When an entity first\nrecognises a financial liability, it shall classify it in accordance with\nparagraphs 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 and measure it in accordance with\nparagraph 5.1.1.\nRegular way purchase or sale of financial assets\nA regular way purchase or sale  of financial assets shall be recognised and\nderecognised, as applicable, using trade date accounting or settlement date\naccounting (see paragraphs B3.1.3–B3.1.6).\n3.2 Derecognition of financial assets\nIn consolidated financial statements, paragraphs 3.2.2 –3.2.9, B3.1.1, B3.1.2\nand B3.2.1–B3.2.17 are applied at a consolidated level. Hence, an entity first\nconsolidates all subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 10 and then applies those\nparagraphs to the resulting group.\nBefore evaluating whether, and to what extent, derecognition is appropriate\nunder paragraphs 3.2.3 –3.2.9, an entity determines whether those\nparagraphs should be applied to a part of a financial asset (or a part of a\ngroup of similar financial assets) or a financial asset (or a group of similar\nfinancial assets) in its entirety, as follows.\n(a) Paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to a part of a financial asset (or a\npart of a group of similar financial assets) if, and only if, the part\nbeing considered for derecognition meets one of the following three\nconditions.\n(i) The part comprises only specifically identified cash flows\nfrom a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets).\nFor example, when an entity enters into an interest rate strip\nwhereby the counterparty obtains the right to the interest\ncash flows, but not the principal cash flows from a debt\ninstrument, paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to the interest\ncash flows.\n3.1.1\n3.1.2\n3.2.1\n3.2.2\nIFRS 9\nA372 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 10}

An entity has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of\nownership of a financial asset if its exposure to the variability in the present\nvalue of the future net cash flows from the financial asset does not change\nsignificantly as a result of the transfer (eg because the entity has sold a\nfinancial asset subject to an agreement to buy it back at a fixed price or the\nsale price plus a lender’s return). An entity has transferred substantially all\nthe risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset if its exposure to such\nvariability is no longer significant in relation to the total variability in the\npresent value of the future net cash flows associated with the financial asset\n(eg because the entity has sold a financial asset subject only to an option to\nbuy it back at its fair value at the time of repurchase or has transferred a fully\nproportionate share of the cash flows from a larger financial asset in an\narrangement, such as a loan sub -participation, that meets the conditions in\nparagraph 3.2.5).\nOften it will be obvious whether the entity has transferred or retained\nsubstantially all risks and rewards of ownership and there will be no need to\nperform any computations. In other cases, it will be necessary to compute and\ncompare the entity’s exposure to the variability in the present value of the\nfuture net cash flows before and after the transfer. The computation and\ncomparison are made using as the discount rate an appropriate current\nmarket interest rate. All reasonably possible variability in net cash flows is\nconsidered, with greater weight being given to those outcomes that are more\nlikely to occur.\nWhether the entity has retained control (see paragraph 3.2.6(c)) of the\ntransferred asset depends on the transferee’s ability to sell the asset. If the\ntransferee has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an\nunrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and\nwithout needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer, the entity\nhas not retained control. In all other cases, the entity has retained control.\nTransfers that qualify for derecognition\nIf an entity transfers a financial asset in a transfer that qualifies for\nderecognition in its entirety and retains the right to service the financial\nasset for a fee, it shall recognise either a servicing asset or a servicing\nliability for that servicing contract.

In subsequent periods, the entity shall recognise\nany income on the transferred asset and any expense incurred on the\nfinancial liability.\nContinuing involvement in transferred assets\nIf an entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and\nrewards of ownership of a transferred asset, and retains control of the\ntransferred asset, the entity continues to recognise the transferred asset to\nthe extent of its continuing involvement. The extent of the entity’s\ncontinuing involvement in the transferred asset is the extent to which it is\nexposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset. For example:\n(a) When the entity’s continuing involvement takes the form of\nguaranteeing the transferred asset, the extent of the entity’s\ncontinuing involvement is the lower of (i) the amount of the asset\nand (ii) the maximum amount of the consideration received that the\nentity could be required to repay (‘the guarantee amount’).\n(b) When the entity’s continuing involvement takes the form of a\nwritten or purchased option (or both) on the transferred asset, the\nextent of the entity’s continuing involvement is the amount of the\ntransferred asset that the entity may repurchase. However, in the\ncase of a written put option on an asset that is measured at fair\nvalue, the extent of the entity’s continuing involvement is limited to\nthe lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option\nexercise price (see paragraph B3.2.13).\n(c) When the entity’s continuing involvement takes the form of a\ncash-settled option or similar provision on the transferred asset, the\nextent of the entity’s continuing involvement is measured in the\nsame way as that which results from non -cash settled options as set\nout in (b) above.\nWhen an entity continues to recognise an asset to the extent of its\ncontinuing involvement, the entity also recognises an associated liability.\nDespite the other measurement requirements in this Standard, the\ntransferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that\nreflects the rights and obligations that the entity has retained. The\nassociated liability is measured in such a way that the net carrying amount\nof the transferred asset and the associated liability is: \n(a) the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained by the\nentity, if the transferred asset is measured at amortised cost, or\n3.2.15\n3.2.16\n3.2.17\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A377", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 15}

For this\npurpose, the requirements of paragraph 3.2.14 apply.

This approach aims to convey the context of hedging\ninstruments for which hedge accounting is applied in order to allow insight\ninto their purpose and effect.\nAn entity may choose to designate a hedging relationship between a hedging\ninstrument and a hedged item in accordance with paragraphs 6.2.1–6.3.7 and\nB6.2.1–B6.3.25. For hedging relationships that meet the qualifying criteria, an\nentity shall account for the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the\nhedged item in accordance with paragraphs 6.5.1 –6.5.14 and B6.5.1–B6.5.28.\nWhen the hedged item is a group of items, an entity shall comply with the\nadditional requirements in paragraphs 6.6.1–6.6.6 and B6.6.1–B6.6.16.\nFor a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial\nassets or financial liabilities (and only for such a hedge), an entity may apply\nthe hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39 instead of those in this\nStandard.

(Those based on climatic variables are sometimes referred\nto as ‘weather derivatives’.) If those contracts are not within the scope of\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, they are within the scope of this Standard.\nThis Standard does not change the requirements relating to employee benefit\nplans that comply with IAS 26 Accounting and Reporting by Retirement Benefit Plans\nand royalty agreements based on the volume of sales or service revenues that\nare accounted for under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nSometimes, an entity makes what it views as a ‘strategic investment’ in equity\ninstruments issued by another entity, with the intention of establishing or\nmaintaining a long -term operating relationship with the entity in which the\ninvestment is made. The investor or joint venturer entity uses IAS 28\nInvestments in Associates and Joint Ventures  to determine whether the equity\nmethod of accounting shall be applied to such an investment.\nThis Standard applies to the financial assets and financial liabilities of\ninsurers, other than rights and obligations that paragraph 2.1(e) excludes\nbecause they arise under contracts within the scope of IFRS 17.\nFinancial guarantee contracts may have various legal forms, such as a\nguarantee, some types of letter of credit, a credit default contract or an\ninsurance contract. Their accounting treatment does not depend on their legal\nform. The following are examples of the appropriate treatment\n(see paragraph 2.1(e)):\n(a) Although a financial guarantee contract meets the definition of an\ninsurance contract in IFRS 17 (see paragraph 7(e) of IFRS 17) if the risk\ntransferred is significant, the issuer applies this Standard.\nNevertheless, if the issuer has previously asserted explicitly that it\nregards such contracts as insurance contracts and has used accounting\nthat is applicable to insurance contracts, the issuer may elect to apply\neither this Standard or IFRS 17 to such financial guarantee contracts. If\nthis Standard applies, paragraph 5.1.1 requires the issuer to recognise a\nfinancial guarantee contract initially at fair value. If the financial\nguarantee contract was issued to an unrelated party in a stand-alone\narm’s length transaction, its fair value at inception is likely to equal\nthe premium received, unless there is evidence to the contrary.\nSubsequently, unless the financial guarantee contract was designated\nat inception as at fair value through profit or loss or\nunless paragraphs 3.2.15 –3.2.23 and B3.2.12–B3.2.17 apply (when a\ntransfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or the\nB2.1\nB2.2\nB2.3\nB2.4\nB2.5\nIFRS 9\nA432 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 70}

An example of such a guarantee is one that requires payments in\nresponse to changes in a specified credit rating or credit index. Such\nguarantees are not financial guarantee contracts as defined in this\nStandard, and are not insurance contracts as defined in IFRS 17. Such\nguarantees are derivatives and the issuer applies this Standard to\nthem.\n(c) If a financial guarantee contract was issued in connection with the sale\nof goods, the issuer applies IFRS 15 in determining when it recognises\nthe revenue from the guarantee and from the sale of goods.\nAssertions that an issuer regards contracts as insurance contracts are typically\nfound throughout the issuer’s communications with customers and\nregulators, contracts, business documentation and financial statements.\nFurthermore, insurance contracts are often subject to accounting\nrequirements that are distinct from the requirements for other types of\ntransaction, such as contracts issued by banks or commercial companies. In\nsuch cases, an issuer’s financial statements typically include a statement that\nthe issuer has used those accounting requirements.\nRecognition and derecognition (Chapter 3)\nInitial recognition (Section 3.1)\nAs a consequence of the principle in paragraph 3.1.1, an entity recognises all\nof its contractual rights and obligations under derivatives in its statement of\nfinancial position as assets and liabilities, respectively, except for derivatives\nthat prevent a transfer of financial assets from being accounted for as a sale\n(see paragraph B3.2.14). If a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for\nderecognition, the transferee does not recognise the transferred asset as its\nasset (see paragraph B3.2.15).\nThe following are examples of applying the principle in paragraph 3.1.1:\n(a) Unconditional receivables and payables are recognised as assets or\nliabilities when the entity becomes a party to the contract and, as a\nconsequence, has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay\ncash.\nB2.6\nB3.1.1\nB3.1.2\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A433", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 71}
{"text": "(b) Assets to be acquired and liabilities to be incurred as a result of a firm\ncommitment to purchase or sell goods or services are generally not\nrecognised until at least one of the parties has performed under the\nagreement. For example, an entity that receives a firm order does not\ngenerally recognise an asset (and the entity that places the order does\nnot recognise a liability) at the time of the commitment but, instead,\ndelays recognition until the ordered goods or services have been\nshipped, delivered or rendered. If a firm commitment to buy or sell\nnon-financial items is within the scope of this Standard in accordance\nwith paragraphs 2.4–2.7, its net fair value is recognised as an asset or a\nliability on the commitment date (see paragraph B4.1.30(c)). In\naddition, if a previously unrecognised firm commitment is designated\nas a hedged item in a fair value hedge, any change in the net fair value\nattributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or a liability\nafter the inception of the hedge (see paragraphs 6.5.8(b) and 6.5.9).\n(c) A forward contract that is within the scope of this Standard (see\nparagraph 2.1) is recognised as an asset or a liability on the\ncommitment date, instead of on the date on which settlement takes\nplace. When an entity becomes a party to a forward contract, the fair\nvalues of the right and obligation are often equal, so that the net fair\nvalue of the forward is zero. If the net fair value of the right and\nobligation is not zero, the contract is recognised as an asset or liability.\n(d) Option contracts that are within the scope of this Standard (see\nparagraph 2.1) are recognised as assets or liabilities when the holder or\nwriter becomes a party to the contract.\n(e) Planned future transactions, no matter how likely, are not assets and\nliabilities because the entity has not become a party to a contract.\nRegular way purchase or sale of financial assets\nA regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognised using either\ntrade date accounting or settlement date accounting as described in\nparagraphs B3.1.5 and B3.1.6.

An entity has retained control\nof a transferred asset if the transferee does not have the practical ability to sell\nthe transferred asset. A transferee has the practical ability to sell the\ntransferred asset if it is traded in an active market because the transferee\ncould repurchase the transferred asset in the market if it needs to return the\nasset to the entity. For example, a transferee may have the practical ability to\nsell a transferred asset if the transferred asset is subject to an option that\nallows the entity to repurchase it, but the transferee can readily obtain the\ntransferred asset in the market if the option is exercised. A transferee does not\nhave the practical ability to sell the transferred asset if the entity retains such\nan option and the transferee cannot readily obtain the transferred asset in the\nmarket if the entity exercises its option.\nThe transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred asset only if the\ntransferee can sell the transferred asset in its entirety to an unrelated third\nparty and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing\nadditional restrictions on the transfer. The critical question is what the\ntransferee is able to do in practice, not what contractual rights the transferee\nhas concerning what it can do with the transferred asset or what contractual\nprohibitions exist. In particular:\n(a) a contractual right to dispose of the transferred asset has little\npractical effect if there is no market for the transferred asset, and\n(b) an ability to dispose of the transferred asset has little practical effect if\nit cannot be exercised freely. For that reason:\n(i) the transferee’s ability to dispose of the transferred asset must\nbe independent of the actions of others (ie it must be a\nunilateral ability), and\n(ii) the transferee must be able to dispose of the transferred asset\nwithout needing to attach restrictive conditions or ‘strings’ to\nthe transfer (eg conditions about how a loan asset is serviced or\nan option giving the transferee the right to repurchase the\nasset).\nThat the transferee is unlikely to sell the transferred asset does not, of itself,\nmean that the transferor has retained control of the transferred asset.\nHowever, if a put option or guarantee constrains the transferee from selling\nthe transferred asset, then the transferor has retained control of the\ntransferred asset. For example, if a put option or guarantee is sufficiently\nvaluable it constrains the transferee from selling the transferred asset because\nthe transferee would, in practice, not sell the transferred asset to a third party\nwithout attaching a similar option or other restrictive conditions. Instead, the\ntransferee would hold the transferred asset so as to obtain payments under\nthe guarantee or put option.

For the purposes of\napplying paragraph 3.2.13, the fair values of the servicing asset and\ninterest-only strip receivable are used to allocate the carrying amount of the\nreceivable between the part of the asset that is derecognised and the part that\ncontinues to be recognised. If there is no servicing fee specified or the fee to be\nreceived is not expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing\nthe servicing, a liability for the servicing obligation is recognised at fair value.\nWhen measuring the fair values of the part that continues to be recognised\nand the part that is derecognised for the purposes of applying\nparagraph 3.2.13, an entity applies the fair value measurement requirements\nin IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement in addition to paragraph 3.2.14.\nTransfers that do not qualify for derecognition\nThe following is an application of the principle outlined in paragraph 3.2.15. If\na guarantee provided by the entity for default losses on the transferred asset\nprevents a transferred asset from being derecognised because the entity has\nretained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the\ntransferred asset, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in its\nentirety and the consideration received is recognised as a liability.\nContinuing involvement in transferred assets\nThe following are examples of how an entity measures a transferred asset and\nthe associated liability under paragraph 3.2.16.\nAll assets\n(a) If a guarantee provided by an entity to pay for default losses on a\ntransferred asset prevents the transferred asset from being\nderecognised to the extent of the continuing involvement, the\ntransferred asset at the date of the transfer is measured at the lower\nof (i) the carrying amount of the asset and (ii) the maximum amount of\nthe consideration received in the transfer that the entity could be\nrequired to repay (‘the guarantee amount’). The associated liability is\ninitially measured at the guarantee amount plus the fair value of the\nguarantee (which is normally the consideration received for the\nguarantee). Subsequently, the initial fair value of the guarantee is\nrecognised in profit or loss when (or as) the obligation is satisfied (in\naccordance with the principles of IFRS 15) and the carrying value of\nthe asset is reduced by any loss allowance.\nB3.2.10\nB3.2.11\nB3.2.12\nB3.2.13\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A439", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 77}
{"text": "Assets measured at amortised cost\n(b) If a put option obligation written by an entity or call option right held\nby an entity prevents a transferred asset from being derecognised and\nthe entity measures the transferred asset at amortised cost, the\nassociated liability is measured at its cost (ie the consideration\nreceived) adjusted for the amortisation of any difference between that\ncost and the gross carrying amount of the transferred asset at the\nexpiration date of the option. For example, assume that the gross\ncarrying amount of the asset on the date of the transfer is CU98 and\nthat the consideration received is CU95. The gross carrying amount of\nthe asset on the option exercise date will be CU100. The initial carrying\namount of the associated liability is CU95 and the difference between\nCU95 and CU100 is recognised in profit or loss using the effective\ninterest method. If the option is exercised, any difference between the\ncarrying amount of the associated liability and the exercise price is\nrecognised in profit or loss.\nAssets measured at fair value\n(c) If a call option right retained by an entity prevents a transferred asset\nfrom being derecognised and the entity measures the transferred asset\nat fair value, the asset continues to be measured at its fair value. The\nassociated liability is measured at (i) the option exercise price less the\ntime value of the option if the option is in or at the money, or (ii) the\nfair value of the transferred asset less the time value of the option if\nthe option is out of the money. The adjustment to the measurement of\nthe associated liability ensures that the net carrying amount of the\nasset and the associated liability is the fair value of the call option\nright. For example, if the fair value of the underlying asset is CU80, the\noption exercise price is CU95 and the time value of the option is CU5,\nthe carrying amount of the associated liability is CU75 (CU80 – CU5)\nand the carrying amount of the transferred asset is CU80 (ie its fair\nvalue).\n(d) If a put option written by an entity prevents a transferred asset from\nbeing derecognised and the entity measures the transferred asset at\nfair value, the associated liability is measured at the option exercise\nprice plus the time value of the option. The measurement of the asset\nat fair value is limited to the lower of the fair value and the option\nexercise price because the entity has no right to increases in the fair\nvalue of the transferred asset above the exercise price of the option.\nThis ensures that the net carrying amount of the asset and the\nassociated liability is the fair value of the put option obligation. For\nexample, if the fair value of the underlying asset is CU120, the option\nexercise price is CU100 and the time value of the option is CU5, the\ncarrying amount of the associated liability is CU105 (CU100 + CU5) and\nthe carrying amount of the asset is CU100 (in this case the option\nexercise price).\nIFRS 9\nA440 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 78}

Assume also that the fair value of the\nasset is CU100 at the date of the transfer. The time value of the put and\ncall are CU1 and CU5 respectively. In this case, the entity recognises an\nasset of CU100 (the fair value of the asset) and a liability of CU96\n[(CU100 + CU1) – CU5].

An entity has no reasonable expectations of recovering the\ncontractual cash flows on a financial asset in its entirety or a portion\nthereof.\nThis paragraph illustrates the application of the continuing involvement\napproach when the entity’s continuing involvement is in a part of a financial\nasset.\nAssume an entity has a portfolio of prepayable loans whose coupon and\neffective interest rate is 10 per cent and whose principal amount and\namortised cost is CU10,000. It enters into a transaction in which, in return\nfor a payment of CU9,115, the transferee obtains the right to CU9,000 of any\ncollections of principal plus interest thereon at 9.5 per cent. The entity\nretains rights to CU1,000 of any collections of principal plus interest thereon\nat 10 per cent, plus the excess spread of 0.5 per cent on the remaining\nCU9,000 of principal. Collections from prepayments are allocated between\nthe entity and the transferee proportionately in the ratio of 1:9, but any\ndefaults are deducted from the entity’s interest of CU1,000 until that\ninterest is exhausted. The fair value of the loans at the date of the\ntransaction is CU10,100 and the fair value of the excess spread of 0.5 per\ncent is CU40.\nThe entity determines that it has transferred some significant risks and\nrewards of ownership (for example, significant prepayment risk) but has also\nretained some significant risks and rewards of ownership (because of its\nsubordinated retained interest) and has retained control. It therefore applies\nthe continuing involvement approach.\nTo apply this Standard, the entity analyses the transaction as (a) a retention\nof a fully proportionate retained interest of CU1,000, plus (b) the\nsubordination of that retained interest to provide credit enhancement to the\ntransferee for credit losses.\ncontinued...\nB3.2.17\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A445", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 83}

{"text": "Classification (Chapter 4)\nClassification of financial assets (Section 4.1)\nThe entity’s business model for managing financial assets\nParagraph 4.1.1(a) requires an entity to classify financial assets on the basis of\nthe entity’s business model for managing the financial assets, unless\nparagraph 4.1.5 applies. An entity assesses whether its financial assets meet\nthe condition in paragraph 4.1.2(a) or the condition in paragraph 4.1.2A(a) on\nthe basis of the business model as determined by the entity’s key management\npersonnel (as defined in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures).\nAn entity’s business model is determined at a level that reflects how groups of\nfinancial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business\nobjective. The entity’s business model does not depend on management’s\nintentions for an individual instrument. Accordingly, this condition is not an\ninstrument-by-instrument approach to classification and should be\ndetermined on a higher level of aggregation. However, a single entity may\nhave more than one business model for managing its financial instruments.\nConsequently, classification need not be determined at the reporting entity\nlevel. For example, an entity may hold a portfolio of investments that it\nmanages in order to collect contractual cash flows and another portfolio of\ninvestments that it manages in order to trade to realise fair value changes.\nSimilarly, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to separate a portfolio\nof financial assets into subportfolios in order to reflect the level at which an\nentity manages those financial assets. For example, that may be the case if an\nentity originates or purchases a portfolio of mortgage loans and manages\nsome of the loans with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows and\nmanages the other loans with an objective of selling them.\nAn entity’s business model refers to how an entity manages its financial assets\nin order to generate cash flows. That is, the entity’s business model\ndetermines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash\nflows, selling financial assets or both. Consequently, this assessment is not\nperformed on the basis of scenarios that the entity does not reasonably expect\nto occur, such as so-called ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios. For example,\nif an entity expects that it will sell a particular portfolio of financial assets\nonly in a stress case scenario, that scenario would not affect the entity’s\nassessment of the business model for those assets if the entity reasonably\nexpects that such a scenario will not occur. If cash flows are realised in a way\nthat is different from the entity’s expectations at the date that the entity\nassessed the business model (for example, if the entity sells more or fewer\nfinancial assets than it expected when it classified the assets), that does not\ngive rise to a prior period error in the entity’s financial statements (see IAS 8\nAccounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors ) nor does it change\nthe classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model\n(ie those assets that the entity recognised in prior periods and still holds) as\nlong as the entity considered all relevant information that was available at the\ntime that it made the business model assessment.

In determining whether cash\nflows are going to be realised by collecting the financial assets’ contractual\ncash flows, it is necessary to consider the frequency, value and timing of sales\nin prior periods, the reasons for those sales and expectations about future\nsales activity. However sales in themselves do not determine the business\nmodel and therefore cannot be considered in isolation. Instead, information\nabout past sales and expectations about future sales provide evidence related\nto how the entity’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is\nachieved and, specifically, how cash flows are realised. An entity must\nconsider information about past sales within the context of the reasons for\nthose sales and the conditions that existed at that time as compared to current\nconditions.\nAlthough the objective of an entity’s business model may be to hold financial\nassets in order to collect contractual cash flows, the entity need not hold all of\nthose instruments until maturity.

Irrespective of their frequency and\nvalue, sales due to an increase in the assets’ credit risk are not inconsistent\nwith a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect\ncontractual cash flows because the credit quality of financial assets is relevant\nto the entity’s ability to collect contractual cash flows. Credit risk\nmanagement activities that are aimed at minimising potential credit losses\ndue to credit deterioration are integral to such a business model.

For example,\nif an entity is assessing a bond with a five-year term and the variable interest\nrate is reset every six months to a five -year rate, the entity cannot conclude\nthat the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\non the principal amount outstanding simply because the interest rate curve at\nthe time of the assessment is such that the difference between a five-year\ninterest rate and a six-month interest rate is not significant.

However, an entity must consider only reasonably\npossible scenarios instead of every possible scenario. If an entity concludes\nthat the contractual (undiscounted) cash flows could be significantly different\nfrom the (undiscounted) benchmark cash flows, the financial asset does not\nmeet the condition in paragraphs 4.1.2(b) and 4.1.2A(b) and therefore cannot\nbe measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive\nincome.\nIn some jurisdictions, the government or a regulatory authority sets interest\nrates.

{"text": "Contractual terms that change the timing or amount of contractual cash\nflows\nIf a financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing\nor amount of contractual cash flows (for example, if the asset can be prepaid\nbefore maturity or its term can be extended), the entity must determine\nwhether the contractual cash flows that could arise over the life of the\ninstrument due to that contractual term are solely payments of principal and\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding. To make this determination,\nthe entity must assess the contractual cash flows that could arise both before,\nand after, the change in contractual cash flows. The entity may also need to\nassess the nature of any contingent event (ie the trigger) that would change\nthe timing or amount of the contractual cash flows. While the nature of the\ncontingent event in itself is not a determinative factor in assessing whether\nthe contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, it\nmay be an indicator. For example, compare a financial instrument with an\ninterest rate that is reset to a higher rate if the debtor misses a particular\nnumber of payments to a financial instrument with an interest rate that is\nreset to a higher rate if a specified equity index reaches a particular level. It is\nmore likely in the former case that the contractual cash flows over the life of\nthe instrument will be solely payments of principal and interest on the\nprincipal amount outstanding because of the relationship between missed\npayments and an increase in credit risk. (See also paragraph B4.1.18.)\nThe following are examples of contractual terms that result in contractual\ncash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal\namount outstanding:\n(a) a variable interest rate that consists of consideration for the time value\nof money, the credit risk associated with the principal amount\noutstanding during a particular period of time (the consideration for\ncredit risk may be determined at initial recognition only, and so may\nbe fixed) and other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit\nmargin;\n(b) a contractual term that permits the issuer (ie the debtor) to prepay a\ndebt instrument or permits the holder (ie the creditor) to put a debt\ninstrument back to the issuer before maturity and the prepayment\namount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include\nreasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract; and\n(c) a contractual term that permits the issuer or the holder to extend the\ncontractual term of a debt instrument (ie an extension option) and the\nterms of the extension option result in contractual cash flows during\nthe extension period that are solely payments of principal and interest\non the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable\nadditional compensation for the extension of the contract.\nB4.1.10\nB4.1.11\nIFRS 9\nA462 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 100}

A reasonable delay is\npermitted provided that each transaction is designated as at fair value through\nprofit or loss at its initial recognition and, at that time, any remaining\ntransactions are expected to occur.\nIt would not be acceptable to designate only some of the financial assets and\nfinancial liabilities giving rise to the inconsistency as at fair value through\nprofit or loss if to do so would not eliminate or significantly reduce the\ninconsistency and would therefore not result in more relevant information.\nHowever, it would be acceptable to designate only some of a number of\nsimilar financial assets or similar financial liabilities if doing so achieves a\nsignificant reduction (and possibly a greater reduction than other allowable\ndesignations) in the inconsistency. For example, assume an entity has a\nnumber of similar financial liabilities that sum to CU100 and a number of\nsimilar financial assets that sum to CU50 but are measured on a different\nbasis. The entity may significantly reduce the measurement inconsistency by\ndesignating at initial recognition all of the assets but only some of the\nliabilities (for example, individual liabilities with a combined total of CU45) as\nat fair value through profit or loss. However, because designation as at fair\nvalue through profit or loss can be applied only to the whole of a financial\ninstrument, the entity in this example must designate one or more liabilities\nin their entirety. It could not designate either a component of a liability\n(eg changes in value attributable to only one risk, such as changes in a\nbenchmark interest rate) or a proportion (ie percentage) of a liability.\nA group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial\nliabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair\nvalue basis\nAn entity may manage and evaluate the performance of a group of financial\nliabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities in such a way that\nmeasuring that group at fair value through profit or loss results in more\nrelevant information. The focus in this instance is on the way the entity\nmanages and evaluates performance, instead of on the nature of its financial\ninstruments.\nFor example, an entity may use this condition to designate financial liabilities\nas at fair value through profit or loss if it meets the principle in\nparagraph 4.2.2(b) and the entity has financial assets and financial liabilities\nthat share one or more risks and those risks are managed and evaluated on a\nfair value basis in accordance with a documented policy of asset and liability\nmanagement. An example could be an entity that has issued ‘structured\nproducts’ containing multiple embedded derivatives and manages the\nresulting risks on a fair value basis using a mix of derivative and\nnon-derivative financial instruments.\nB4.1.31\nB4.1.32\nB4.1.33\nB4.1.34\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A475", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 113}

Accordingly, (subject to the requirement of designation at\ninitial recognition) an entity that designates financial liabilities as at fair value\nthrough profit or loss on the basis of this condition shall so designate all\neligible financial liabilities that are managed and evaluated together.\nDocumentation of the entity’s strategy need not be extensive but should be\nsufficient to demonstrate compliance with paragraph 4.2.2(b) . Such\ndocumentation is not required for each individual item, but may be on a\nportfolio basis. For example, if the performance management system for a\ndepartment—as approved by the entity’s key management personnel—clearly\ndemonstrates that its performance is evaluated on this basis, no further\ndocumentation is required to demonstrate compliance with\nparagraph 4.2.2(b).\nEmbedded derivatives (Section 4.3)\nWhen an entity becomes a party to a hybrid contract with a host that is not an\nasset within the scope of this Standard, paragraph 4.3.3 requires the entity to\nidentify any embedded derivative, assess whether it is required to be separated\nfrom the host contract and, for those that are required to be separated,\nmeasure the derivatives at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently at\nfair value through profit or loss.\nIf a host contract has no stated or predetermined maturity and represents a\nresidual interest in the net assets of an entity, then its economic\ncharacteristics and risks are those of an equity instrument, and an embedded\nderivative would need to possess equity characteristics related to the same\nentity to be regarded as closely related. If the host contract is not an equity\ninstrument and meets the definition of a financial instrument, then its\neconomic characteristics and risks are those of a debt instrument.\nAn embedded non-option derivative (such as an embedded forward or swap) is\nseparated from its host contract on the basis of its stated or implied\nsubstantive terms, so as to result in it having a fair value of zero at initial\nrecognition. An embedded option -based derivative (such as an embedded put,\ncall, cap, floor or swaption) is separated from its host contract on the basis of\nthe stated terms of the option feature. The initial carrying amount of the host\ninstrument is the residual amount after separating the embedded derivative.\nGenerally, multiple embedded derivatives in a single hybrid contract are\ntreated as a single compound embedded derivative. However, embedded\nderivatives that are classified as equity (see IAS 32 Financial Instruments:\nPresentation) are accounted for separately from those classified as assets or\nliabilities. In addition, if a hybrid contract has more than one embedded\nderivative and those derivatives relate to different risk exposures and are\nreadily separable and independent of each other, they are accounted for\nseparately from each other.\nB4.1.35\nB4.1.36\nB4.3.1\nB4.3.2\nB4.3.3\nB4.3.4\nIFRS 9\nA476 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 114}

Such changes\nare expected to be very infrequent. Such changes are determined by the\nentity’s senior management as a result of external or internal changes and\nmust be significant to the entity’s operations and demonstrable to external\nparties. Accordingly, a change in an entity’s business model will occur only\nwhen an entity either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant\nto its operations; for example, when the entity has acquired, disposed of or\nterminated a business line. Examples of a change in business model include\nthe following:\n(a) An entity has a portfolio of commercial loans that it holds to sell in the\nshort term. The entity acquires a company that manages commercial\nloans and has a business model that holds the loans in order to collect\nthe contractual cash flows. The portfolio of commercial loans is no\nlonger for sale, and the portfolio is now managed together with the\nacquired commercial loans and all are held to collect the contractual\ncash flows.\n(b) A financial services firm decides to shut down its retail mortgage\nbusiness.

For example, if a financial services firm\ndecides on 15 February to shut down its retail mortgage business and hence\nmust reclassify all affected financial assets on 1 April (ie the first day of the\nentity’s next reporting period), the entity must not accept new retail mortgage\nbusiness or otherwise engage in activities consistent with its former business\nmodel after 15 February.\nB4.3.12\nB4.4.1\nB4.4.2\n4 IFRS 3 addresses the acquisition of contracts with embedded derivatives in a business\ncombination.\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A481", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 119}

However, if part of the consideration\ngiven or received is for something other than the financial instrument, an\nentity shall measure the fair value of the financial instrument. For example,\nthe fair value of a long -term loan or receivable that carries no interest can be\nmeasured as the present value of all future cash receipts discounted using the\nprevailing market rate(s) of interest for a similar instrument (similar as to\ncurrency, term, type of interest rate and other factors) with a similar credit\nrating. Any additional amount lent is an expense or a reduction of income\nunless it qualifies for recognition as some other type of asset.\nIf an entity originates a loan that bears an off -market interest rate (eg 5 per\ncent when the market rate for similar loans is 8 per cent), and receives an\nupfront fee as compensation, the entity recognises the loan at its fair value,\nie net of the fee it receives.\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial\nrecognition is normally the transaction price (ie the fair value of the\nconsideration given or received, see also IFRS 13). If an entity determines that\nthe fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price as\nmentioned in paragraph 5.1.1A, the entity shall account for that instrument\nat that date as follows:\n(a) at the measurement required by paragraph 5.1.1 if that fair value is\nevidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset\nor liability (ie a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that\nuses only data from observable markets.

However, a shorter period is\nused if this is the period to which the fees, points paid or received, transaction\ncosts, premiums or discounts relate.

In such a case, the appropriate amortisation period\nis the period to the next such repricing date. For example, if a premium or\ndiscount on a floating-rate financial instrument reflects the interest that has\naccrued on that financial instrument since the interest was last paid, or\nchanges in the market rates since the floating interest rate was reset to the\nmarket rates, it will be amortised to the next date when the floating interest is\nreset to market rates. This is because the premium or discount relates to the\nperiod to the next interest reset date because, at that date, the variable to\nwhich the premium or discount relates (ie interest rates) is reset to the market\nrates. If, however, the premium or discount results from a change in the\ncredit spread over the floating rate specified in the financial instrument, or\nother variables that are not reset to the market rates, it is amortised over the\nexpected life of the financial instrument.\nFor floating-rate financial assets and floating-rate financial liabilities, periodic\nre-estimation of cash flows to reflect the movements in the market rates of\ninterest alters the effective interest rate. If a floating-rate financial asset or a\nfloating-rate financial liability is recognised initially at an amount equal to the\nprincipal receivable or payable on maturity, re-estimating the future interest\npayments normally has no significant effect on the carrying amount of the\nasset or the liability.\nB5.4.3\nB5.4.4\nB5.4.5\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A485", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 123}

An entity is required to include the initial\nexpected credit losses in the estimated cash flows when calculating the credit-\nadjusted effective interest rate for financial assets that are considered to be\npurchased or originated credit-impaired at initial recognition.

Consequently when reasonable and supportable information that is\nmore forward-looking than past due information is available without undue\ncost or effort, it must be used to assess changes in credit risk.\nHowever, depending on the nature of the financial instruments and the credit\nrisk information available for particular groups of financial instruments, an\nentity may not be able to identify significant changes in credit risk for\nindividual financial instruments before the financial instrument becomes past\ndue. This may be the case for financial instruments such as retail loans for\nwhich there is little or no updated credit risk information that is routinely\nobtained and monitored on an individual instrument until a customer\nbreaches the contractual terms. If changes in the credit risk for individual\nfinancial instruments are not captured before they become past due, a loss\nallowance based only on credit information at an individual financial\ninstrument level would not faithfully represent the changes in credit risk\nsince initial recognition.\nIn some circumstances an entity does not have reasonable and supportable\ninformation that is available without undue cost or effort to measure lifetime\nexpected credit losses on an individual instrument basis.

In order to meet this objective, if an entity\nis not able to group financial instruments for which the credit risk is\nconsidered to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on\nshared credit risk characteristics, the entity should recognise lifetime\nexpected credit losses on a portion of the financial assets for which credit risk\nis deemed to have increased significantly. The aggregation of financial\ninstruments to assess whether there are changes in credit risk on a collective\nbasis may change over time as new information becomes available on groups\nof, or individual, financial instruments.\nTiming of recognising lifetime expected credit losses\nThe assessment of whether lifetime expected credit losses should be\nrecognised is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a\ndefault occurring since initial recognition (irrespective of whether a financial\ninstrument has been repriced to reflect an increase in credit risk) instead of on\nevidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an\nactual default occurring. Generally, there will be a significant increase in\ncredit risk before a financial asset becomes credit-impaired or an actual\ndefault occurs.\nFor loan commitments, an entity considers changes in the risk of a default\noccurring on the loan to which a loan commitment relates. For financial\nguarantee contracts, an entity considers the changes in the risk that the\nspecified debtor will default on the contract.\nThe significance of a change in the credit risk since initial recognition depends\non the risk of a default occurring as at initial recognition. Thus, a given\nchange, in absolute terms, in the risk of a default occurring will be more\nsignificant for a financial instrument with a lower initial risk of a default\noccurring compared to a financial instrument with a higher initial risk of a\ndefault occurring.\nThe risk of a default occurring on financial instruments that have comparable\ncredit risk is higher the longer the expected life of the instrument; for\nexample, the risk of a default occurring on an AAA-rated bond with an\nexpected life of 10 years is higher than that on an AAA-rated bond with an\nexpected life of five years.\nBecause of the relationship between the expected life and the risk of a default\noccurring, the change in credit risk cannot be assessed simply by comparing\nthe change in the absolute risk of a default occurring over time.

Accordingly, cash shortfalls are the\nexpected payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs less\nany amounts that the entity expects to receive from the holder, the debtor or\nany other party.

The degree of judgement that is\nrequired to estimate expected credit losses depends on the availability of\ndetailed information. As the forecast horizon increases, the availability of\ndetailed information decreases and the degree of judgement required to\nestimate expected credit losses increases. The estimate of expected credit\nlosses does not require a detailed estimate for periods that are far in the\nfuture—for such periods, an entity may extrapolate projections from\navailable, detailed information.\nAn entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information but shall\nconsider all reasonable and supportable information that is available without\nundue cost or effort and that is relevant to the estimate of expected credit\nlosses, including the effect of expected prepayments. The information used\nshall include factors that are specific to the borrower, general economic\nconditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast\ndirection of conditions at the reporting date. An entity may use various\nsources of data, that may be both internal (entity-specific) and external.\nPossible data sources include internal historical credit loss  experience,\ninternal ratings, credit loss experience of other entities and external ratings,\nreports and statistics.

Consequently,\nthe method used shall enable each group of financial assets to be associated\nwith information about past credit loss experience in groups of financial\nassets with similar risk characteristics and with relevant observable data that\nreflects current conditions.\nExpected credit losses reflect an entity’s own expectations of credit losses .\nHowever, when considering all reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable without undue cost or effort in estimating expected credit losses, an\nentity should also consider observable market information about the credit\nrisk of the particular financial instrument or similar financial instruments.\nCollateral\nFor the purposes of measuring expected credit losses, the estimate of expected\ncash shortfalls shall reflect the cash flows expected from collateral and other\ncredit enhancements that are part of the contractual terms and are not\nrecognised separately by the entity. The estimate of expected cash shortfalls\non a collateralised financial instrument reflects the amount and timing of\ncash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collateral less the costs of\nobtaining and selling the collateral, irrespective of whether foreclosure is\nprobable (ie the estimate of expected cash flows considers the probability of a\nforeclosure and the cash flows that would result from it). Consequently, any\ncash flows that are expected from the realisation of the collateral beyond the\ncontractual maturity of the contract should be included in this analysis.

Consequently, when an entity reclassifies a financial asset out of\nthe fair value through profit or loss measurement category, the effective\ninterest rate is determined on the basis of the fair value of the asset at the\nreclassification date.

Dividends on such investments are recognised in profit or loss in\naccordance with paragraph 5.7.6 unless the dividend clearly represents a\nrecovery of part of the cost of the investment.\nUnless paragraph 4.1.5 applies, paragraph 4.1.2A requires that a financial\nasset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if the\ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely\npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and\nthe asset is held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both\ncollecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. This\nmeasurement category recognises information in profit or loss as if the\nfinancial asset is measured at amortised cost, while the financial asset is\nmeasured in the statement of financial position at fair value.

An entity must apply consistently its methodology for determining\nwhether presenting in other comprehensive income the effects of changes in\nthe liability’s credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in\nprofit or loss. However, an entity may use different methodologies when there\nare different economic relationships between the characteristics of the\nliabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss and the\ncharacteristics of the other financial instruments. IFRS 7 requires an entity to\nprovide qualitative disclosures in the notes to the financial statements about\nits methodology for making that determination.\nIf such a mismatch would be created or enlarged, the entity is required to\npresent all changes in fair value (including the effects of changes in the credit\nrisk of the liability) in profit or loss. If such a mismatch would not be created\nor enlarged, the entity is required to present the effects of changes in the\nliability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income.\nAmounts presented in other comprehensive income shall not be subsequently\ntransferred to profit or loss. However, the entity may transfer the cumulative\ngain or loss within equity.\nThe following example describes a situation in which an accounting mismatch\nwould be created in profit or loss if the effects of changes in the credit risk of\nthe liability were presented in other comprehensive income. A mortgage bank\nprovides loans to customers and funds those loans by selling bonds with\nmatching characteristics (eg amount outstanding, repayment profile, term\nand currency) in the market. The contractual terms of the loan permit the\nmortgage customer to prepay its loan (ie satisfy its obligation to the bank) by\nbuying the corresponding bond at fair value in the market and delivering that\nbond to the mortgage bank. As a result of that contractual prepayment right,\nif the credit quality of the bond worsens (and, thus, the fair value of the\nmortgage bank’s liability decreases), the fair value of the mortgage bank’s\nloan asset also decreases. The change in the fair value of the asset reflects the\nmortgage customer’s contractual right to prepay the mortgage loan by buying\nthe underlying bond at fair value (which, in this example, has decreased) and\ndelivering the bond to the mortgage bank. Consequently, the effects of\nchanges in the credit risk of the liability (the bond) will be offset in profit or\nloss by a corresponding change in the fair value of a financial asset (the loan).\nIf the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk were presented in other\ncomprehensive income there would be an accounting mismatch in profit or\nloss. Consequently, the mortgage bank is required to present all changes in\nfair value of the liability (including the effects of changes in the liability’s\ncredit risk) in profit or loss.\nIn the example in paragraph B5.7.10, there is a contractual linkage between\nthe effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability and changes in the fair\nvalue of the financial asset (ie as a result of the mortgage customer’s\ncontractual right to prepay the loan by buying the bond at fair value and\ndelivering the bond to the mortgage bank).

{"text": "For the purposes of applying the requirements in paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8,\nan accounting mismatch is not caused solely by the measurement method\nthat an entity uses to determine the effects of changes in a liability’s credit\nrisk. An accounting mismatch in profit or loss would arise only when the\neffects of changes in the liability’s credit risk (as defined in IFRS 7 ) are\nexpected to be offset by changes in the fair value of another financial\ninstrument. A mismatch that arises solely as a result of the measurement\nmethod (ie because an entity does not isolate changes in a liability’s credit risk\nfrom some other changes in its fair value) does not affect the determination\nrequired by paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8. For example, an entity may not isolate\nchanges in a liability’s credit risk from changes in liquidity risk. If the entity\npresents the combined effect of both factors in other comprehensive income, a\nmismatch may occur because changes in liquidity risk may be included in the\nfair value measurement of the entity’s financial assets and the entire fair\nvalue change of those assets is presented in profit or loss. However, such a\nmismatch is caused by measurement imprecision, not the offsetting\nrelationship described in paragraph B5.7.6 and, therefore, does not affect the\ndetermination required by paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8.\nThe meaning of ‘credit risk’ (paragraphs 5.7.7 and 5.7.8)\nIFRS 7 defines credit risk as ‘the risk that one party to a financial instrument\nwill cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an\nobligation’. The requirement in paragraph 5.7.7(a) relates to the risk that the\nissuer will fail to perform on that particular liability. It does not necessarily\nrelate to the creditworthiness of the issuer. For example, if an entity issues a\ncollateralised liability and a non -collateralised liability that are otherwise\nidentical, the credit risk of those two liabilities will be different, even though\nthey are issued by the same entity. The credit risk on the collateralised\nliability will be less than the credit risk of the non -collateralised liability. The\ncredit risk for a collateralised liability may be close to zero.\nFor the purposes of applying the requirement in paragraph 5.7.7(a), credit risk\nis different from asset -specific performance risk. Asset -specific performance\nrisk is not related to the risk that an entity will fail to discharge a particular\nobligation but instead it is related to the risk that a single asset or a group of\nassets will perform poorly (or not at all).\nThe following are examples of asset-specific performance risk:\n(a) a liability with a unit -linking feature whereby the amount due to\ninvestors is contractually determined on the basis of the performance\nof specified assets. The effect of that unit -linking feature on the fair\nvalue of the liability is asset-specific performance risk, not credit risk.\n(b) a liability issued by a structured entity with the following\ncharacteristics.

It deducts from this\nrate of return the observed (benchmark) interest rate at the start of the\nperiod, to arrive at an instrument -specific component of the internal\nrate of return.\n(b) Next, the entity calculates the present value of the cash flows\nassociated with the liability using the liability’s contractual cash flows\nat the end of the period and a discount rate equal to the sum of (i) the\nobserved (benchmark) interest rate at the end of the period and (ii) the\ninstrument-specific component of the internal rate of return as\ndetermined in (a).\n(c) The difference between the fair value of the liability at the end of the\nperiod and the amount determined in (b) is the change in fair value\nthat is not attributable to changes in the observed (benchmark)\ninterest rate. This is the amount to be presented in other\ncomprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.7(a).\nThe example in paragraph B5.7.18 assumes that changes in fair value arising\nfrom factors other than changes in the instrument’s credit risk or changes in\nobserved (benchmark) interest rates are not significant. This method would\nnot be appropriate if changes in fair value arising from other factors are\nsignificant. In those cases, an entity is required to use an alternative method\nthat more faithfully measures the effects of changes in the liability’s credit\nrisk (see paragraph B5.7.16(b)).

In that case, the entity may designate the hedged item on the basis of\nthe aggregated exposure. For example:\n(a) an entity may hedge a given quantity of highly probable coffee\npurchases in 15 months’ time against price risk (based on US dollars)\nusing a 15-month futures contract for coffee. The highly probable\ncoffee purchases and the futures contract for coffee in combination\ncan be viewed as a 15-month fixed-amount US dollar foreign currency\nrisk exposure for risk management purposes (ie like any fixed-amount\nUS dollar cash outflow in 15 months’ time).\n(b) an entity may hedge the foreign currency risk for the entire term of a\n10-year fixed-rate debt denominated in a foreign currency. However,\nthe entity requires fixed-rate exposure in its functional currency only\nfor a short to medium term (say two years) and floating rate exposure\nin its functional currency for the remaining term to maturity. At the\nend of each of the two-year intervals (ie on a two-year rolling basis) the\nentity fixes the next two years’ interest rate exposure (if the interest\nlevel is such that the entity wants to fix interest rates). In such a\nsituation an entity may enter into a 10-year fixed-to-floating cross-\ncurrency interest rate swap that swaps the fixed-rate foreign currency\ndebt into a variable-rate functional currency exposure. This is overlaid\nwith a two-year interest rate swap that—on the basis of the functional\ncurrency—swaps variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. In effect, the\nfixed-rate foreign currency debt and the 10-year fixed-to-floating cross-\ncurrency interest rate swap in combination are viewed as a 10-year\nvariable-rate debt functional currency exposure for risk management\npurposes.\nB6.3.1\nB6.3.2\nB6.3.3\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A507", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 145}
{"text": "When designating the hedged item on the basis of the aggregated exposure,\nan entity considers the combined effect of the items that constitute the\naggregated exposure for the purpose of assessing hedge effectiveness and\nmeasuring hedge ineffectiveness. However, the items that constitute the\naggregated exposure remain accounted for separately. This means that, for\nexample:\n(a) derivatives  that are part of an aggregated exposure are recognised as\nseparate assets or liabilities measured at fair value; and\n(b) if a hedging relationship is designated between the items that\nconstitute the aggregated exposure, the way in which a derivative is\nincluded as part of an aggregated exposure must be consistent with the\ndesignation of that derivative as the hedging instrument at the level of\nthe aggregated exposure. For example, if an entity excludes the\nforward element of a derivative from its designation as the hedging\ninstrument for the hedging relationship between the items that\nconstitute the aggregated exposure, it must also exclude the forward\nelement when including that derivative as a hedged item as part of the\naggregated exposure. Otherwise, the aggregated exposure shall include\na derivative, either in its entirety or a proportion of it.\nParagraph 6.3.6 states that in consolidated financial statements the foreign\ncurrency risk of a highly probable forecast intragroup transaction may qualify\nas a hedged item in a cash flow hedge, provided that the transaction is\ndenominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity\nentering into that transaction and that the foreign currency risk will affect\nconsolidated profit or loss. For this purpose an entity can be a parent,\nsubsidiary, associate, joint arrangement or branch. If the foreign currency risk\nof a forecast intragroup transaction does not affect consolidated profit or loss,\nthe intragroup transaction cannot qualify as a hedged item. This is usually the\ncase for royalty payments, interest payments or management charges between\nmembers of the same group, unless there is a related external transaction.\nHowever, when the foreign currency risk of a forecast intragroup transaction\nwill affect consolidated profit or loss, the intragroup transaction can qualify as\na hedged item. An example is forecast sales or purchases of inventories\nbetween members of the same group if there is an onward sale of the\ninventory to a party external to the group. Similarly, a forecast intragroup sale\nof plant and equipment from the group entity that manufactured it to a group\nentity that will use the plant and equipment in its operations may affect\nconsolidated profit or loss. This could occur, for example, because the plant\nand equipment will be depreciated by the purchasing entity and the amount\ninitially recognised for the plant and equipment may change if the forecast\nintragroup transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency of the purchasing entity.\nIf a hedge of a forecast intragroup transaction qualifies for hedge accounting,\nany gain or loss is recognised in, and taken out of, other comprehensive\nincome in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11. The relevant period or periods\nduring which the foreign currency risk of the hedged transaction affects profit\nor loss is when it affects consolidated profit or loss.\nB6.3.4\nB6.3.5\nB6.3.6\nIFRS 9\nA508 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 146}

Consequently,\na component reflects only some of the risks of the item of which it is a part or\nreflects the risks only to some extent (for example, when designating a\nproportion of an item).\nRisk components\nTo be eligible for designation as a hedged item, a risk component must be a\nseparately identifiable component of the financial or the non-financial item,\nand the changes in the cash flows or the fair value of the item attributable to\nchanges in that risk component must be reliably measurable.\nWhen identifying what risk components qualify for designation as a hedged\nitem, an entity assesses such risk components within the context of the\nparticular market structure to which the risk or risks relate and in which the\nhedging activity takes place. Such a determination requires an evaluation of\nthe relevant facts and circumstances, which differ by risk and market.\nWhen designating risk components as hedged items, an entity considers\nwhether the risk components are explicitly specified in a contract\n(contractually specified risk components) or whether they are implicit in the\nfair value or the cash flows of an item of which they are a part (non-\ncontractually specified risk components). Non -contractually specified risk\ncomponents can relate to items that are not a contract (for example, forecast\ntransactions) or contracts that do not explicitly specify the component (for\nexample, a firm commitment that includes only one single price instead of a\npricing formula that references different underlyings). For example:\n(a) Entity A has a long-term supply contract for natural gas that is priced\nusing a contractually specified formula that references commodities\nand other factors (for example, gas oil, fuel oil and other components\nsuch as transport charges). Entity A hedges the gas oil component in\nthat supply contract using a gas oil forward contract. Because the gas\noil component is specified by the terms and conditions of the supply\ncontract it is a contractually specified risk component. Hence, because\nof the pricing formula, Entity A concludes that the gas oil price\nexposure is separately identifiable. At the same time, there is a market\nfor gas oil forward contracts. Hence, Entity A concludes that the gas oil\nprice exposure is reliably measurable. Consequently, the gas oil price\nexposure in the supply contract is a risk component that is eligible for\ndesignation as a hedged item.\n(b) Entity B hedges its future coffee purchases based on its production\nforecast.

These contracts price\na tonne of coffee based on the exchange-traded coffee futures\ncontract price plus a fixed price differential plus a variable\nlogistics services charge using a pricing formula. The coffee\nsupply contract is an executory contract in accordance with\nwhich Entity B takes actual delivery of coffee.\nFor deliveries that relate to the current harvest, entering into the\ncoffee supply contracts allows Entity B to fix the price differential\nbetween the actual coffee quality purchased (Arabica coffee from\nColombia) and the benchmark quality that is the underlying of the\nexchange-traded futures contract. However, for deliveries that relate to\nthe next harvest, the coffee supply contracts are not yet available, so\nthe price differential cannot be fixed. Entity B uses exchange-traded\ncoffee futures contracts to hedge the benchmark quality component of\nits coffee price risk for deliveries that relate to the current harvest as\nwell as the next harvest. Entity B determines that it is exposed to three\ndifferent risks: coffee price risk reflecting the benchmark quality,\ncoffee price risk reflecting the difference (spread) between the price for\nthe benchmark quality coffee and the particular Arabica coffee from\nColombia that it actually receives, and the variable logistics costs. For\ndeliveries related to the current harvest, after Entity B enters into a\ncoffee supply contract, the coffee price risk reflecting the benchmark\nquality is a contractually specified risk component because the pricing\nformula includes an indexation to the exchange-traded coffee futures\ncontract price. Entity B concludes that this risk component is\nseparately identifiable and reliably measurable. For deliveries related\nto the next harvest, Entity B has not yet entered into any coffee supply\ncontracts (ie those deliveries are forecast transactions). Hence, the\ncoffee price risk reflecting the benchmark quality is a non-\ncontractually specified risk component. Entity B’s analysis of the\nmarket structure takes into account how eventual deliveries of the\nparticular coffee that it receives are priced. Hence, on the basis of this\nanalysis of the market structure, Entity B concludes that the forecast\ntransactions also involve the coffee price risk that reflects the\nbenchmark quality as a risk component that is separately identifiable\nand reliably measurable even though it is not contractually specified.\nConsequently, Entity B may designate hedging relationships on a risk\ncomponents basis (for the coffee price risk that reflects the benchmark\nquality) for coffee supply contracts as well as forecast transactions.\n(c) Entity C hedges part of its future jet fuel purchases on the basis of its\nconsumption forecast up to 24 months before delivery and increases\nthe volume that it hedges over time.

Entity C’s analysis of the market structure for oil and\noil products and its evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances\nis as follows:\n(i) Entity C operates in a geographical area in which Brent is the\ncrude oil benchmark. Crude oil is a raw material benchmark\nthat affects the price of various refined oil products as their\nmost basic input. Gas oil is a benchmark for refined oil\nproducts, which is used as a pricing reference for oil distillates\nmore generally. This is also reflected in the types of derivative\nfinancial instruments for the crude oil and refined oil products\nmarkets of the environment in which Entity C operates, such\nas:\n• the benchmark crude oil futures contract, which is for\nBrent crude oil;\n• the benchmark gas oil futures contract, which is used as the\npricing reference for distillates—for example, jet fuel\nspread derivatives cover the price differential between jet\nfuel and that benchmark gas oil; and\n• the benchmark gas oil crack spread derivative (ie the\nderivative for the price differential between crude oil and\ngas oil—a refining margin), which is indexed to Brent crude\noil.\n(ii) the pricing of refined oil products does not depend on which\nparticular crude oil is processed by a particular refinery\nbecause those refined oil products (such as gas oil or jet fuel)\nare standardised products.\nHence, Entity C concludes that the price risk of its jet fuel purchases\nincludes a crude oil price risk component based on Brent crude oil and\na gas oil price risk component, even though crude oil and gas oil are\nnot specified in any contractual arrangement. Entity C concludes that\nthese two risk components are separately identifiable and reliably\nmeasurable even though they are not contractually specified.\nConsequently, Entity C may designate hedging relationships for\nforecast jet fuel purchases on a risk components basis (for crude oil or\ngas oil). This analysis also means that if, for example, Entity C used\ncrude oil derivatives based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil,\nchanges in the price differential between Brent crude oil and WTI\ncrude oil would cause hedge ineffectiveness.\n(d) Entity D holds a fixed-rate debt instrument. This instrument is issued\nin an environment with a market in which a large variety of similar\ndebt instruments are compared by their spreads to a benchmark rate\n(for example, LIBOR) and variable-rate instruments in that\nenvironment are typically indexed to that benchmark rate.

The price of fixed-rate debt instruments varies\ndirectly in response to changes in the benchmark rate as they happen.\nEntity D concludes that the benchmark rate is a component that can\nbe separately identified and reliably measured. Consequently, Entity D\nmay designate hedging relationships for the fixed-rate debt instrument\non a risk component basis for the benchmark interest rate risk.\nWhen designating a risk component as a hedged item, the hedge accounting\nrequirements apply to that risk component in the same way as they apply to\nother hedged items that are not risk components. For example, the qualifying\ncriteria apply, including that the hedging relationship must meet the hedge\neffectiveness requirements, and any hedge ineffectiveness must be measured\nand recognised.\nAn entity can also designate only changes in the cash flows or fair value of a\nhedged item above or below a specified price or other variable (a ‘one-sided\nrisk’). The intrinsic value of a purchased option hedging instrument (assuming\nthat it has the same principal terms as the designated risk), but not its time\nvalue, reflects a one-sided risk in a hedged item. For example, an entity can\ndesignate the variability of future cash flow outcomes resulting from a price\nincrease of a forecast commodity purchase. In such a situation, the entity\ndesignates only cash flow losses that result from an increase in the price above\nthe specified level. The hedged risk does not include the time value of a\npurchased option, because the time value is not a component of the forecast\ntransaction that affects profit or loss.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that unless inflation risk is contractually\nspecified, it is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable and hence\ncannot be designated as a risk component of a financial instrument. However,\nin limited cases, it is possible to identify a risk component for inflation risk\nthat is separately identifiable and reliably measurable because of the\nparticular circumstances of the inflation environment and the relevant debt\nmarket.\nFor example, an entity issues debt in an environment in which inflation-\nlinked bonds have a volume and term structure that results in a sufficiently\nliquid market that allows constructing a term structure of zero-coupon real\ninterest rates. This means that for the respective currency, inflation is a\nrelevant factor that is separately considered by the debt markets. In those\ncircumstances the inflation risk component could be determined by\ndiscounting the cash flows of the hedged debt instrument using the term\nstructure of zero-coupon real interest rates (ie in a manner similar to how a\nrisk-free (nominal) interest rate component can be determined). Conversely, in\nmany cases an inflation risk component is not separately identifiable and\nreliably measurable. For example, an entity issues only nominal interest rate\ndebt in an environment with a market for inflation-linked bonds that is not\nsufficiently liquid to allow a term structure of zero-coupon real interest rates\nto be constructed. In this case the analysis of the market structure and of the\nfacts and circumstances does not support the entity concluding that inflation\nis a relevant factor that is separately considered by the debt markets.

The mere existence of a statistical correlation between two variables\ndoes not, by itself, support a valid conclusion that an economic relationship\nexists.\nThe effect of credit risk\nBecause the hedge accounting model is based on a general notion of offset\nbetween gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item,\nhedge effectiveness is determined not only by the economic relationship\nbetween those items (ie the changes in their underlyings) but also by the effect\nof credit risk on the value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged\nitem. The effect of credit risk means that even if there is an economic\nrelationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the level\nof offset might become erratic. This can result from a change in the credit risk\nof either the hedging instrument or the hedged item that is of such a\nmagnitude that the credit risk dominates the value changes that result from\nthe economic relationship (ie the effect of the changes in the underlyings). A\nlevel of magnitude that gives rise to dominance is one that would result in the\nloss (or gain) from credit risk frustrating the effect of changes in the\nunderlyings on the value of the hedging instrument or the hedged item, even\nif those changes were significant.

{"text": "there is little change in the underlyings, the fact that even small credit\nrisk-related changes in the value of the hedging instrument or the hedged\nitem might affect the value more than the underlyings does not create\ndominance.\nAn example of credit risk dominating a hedging relationship is when an entity\nhedges an exposure to commodity price risk using an uncollateralised\nderivative. If the counterparty to that derivative experiences a severe\ndeterioration in its credit standing, the effect of the changes in the\ncounterparty’s credit standing might outweigh the effect of changes in the\ncommodity price on the fair value of the hedging instrument, whereas\nchanges in the value of the hedged item depend largely on the commodity\nprice changes.\nHedge ratio\nIn accordance with the hedge effectiveness requirements, the hedge ratio of\nthe hedging relationship must be the same as that resulting from the quantity\nof the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the\nhedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of\nhedged item. Hence, if an entity hedges less than 100 per cent of the exposure\non an item, such as 85 per cent, it shall designate the hedging relationship\nusing a hedge ratio that is the same as that resulting from 85 per cent of the\nexposure and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually\nuses to hedge those 85 per cent. Similarly, if, for example, an entity hedges an\nexposure using a nominal amount of 40 units of a financial instrument, it\nshall designate the hedging relationship using a hedge ratio that is the same\nas that resulting from that quantity of 40 units (ie the entity must not use a\nhedge ratio based on a higher quantity of units that it might hold in total or a\nlower quantity of units) and the quantity of the hedged item that it actually\nhedges with those 40 units.\nHowever, the designation of the hedging relationship using the same hedge\nratio as that resulting from the quantities of the hedged item and the hedging\ninstrument that the entity actually uses shall not reflect an imbalance\nbetween the weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that\nwould in turn create hedge ineffectiveness (irrespective of whether recognised\nor not) that could result in an accounting outcome that would be inconsistent\nwith the purpose of hedge accounting. Hence, for the purpose of designating a\nhedging relationship, an entity must adjust the hedge ratio that results from\nthe quantities of the hedged item and the hedging instrument that the entity\nactually uses if that is needed to avoid such an imbalance.\nExamples of relevant considerations in assessing whether an accounting\noutcome is inconsistent with the purpose of hedge accounting are:\n(a) whether the intended hedge ratio is established to avoid recognising\nhedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges, or to achieve fair value\nhedge adjustments for more hedged items with the aim of increasing\nthe use of fair value accounting, but without offsetting fair value\nchanges of the hedging instrument; and\nB6.4.8\nB6.4.9\nB6.4.10\nB6.4.11\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A517", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 155}

An example is an entity that hedges 100 tonnes of coffee\npurchases with standard coffee futures contracts that have a contract\nsize of 37,500 lbs (pounds). The entity could only use either five or six\ncontracts (equivalent to 85.0 and 102.1 tonnes respectively) to hedge\nthe purchase volume of 100 tonnes. In that case, the entity designates\nthe hedging relationship using the hedge ratio that results from the\nnumber of coffee futures contracts that it actually uses, because the\nhedge ineffectiveness resulting from the mismatch in the weightings\nof the hedged item and the hedging instrument would not result in an\naccounting outcome that is inconsistent with the purpose of hedge\naccounting.\nFrequency of assessing whether the hedge effectiveness\nrequirements are met\nAn entity shall assess at the inception of the hedging relationship, and on an\nongoing basis, whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness\nrequirements.

The\nassessment relates to expectations about hedge effectiveness and is therefore\nonly forward-looking.\nMethods for assessing whether the hedge effectiveness\nrequirements are met\nThis Standard does not specify a method for assessing whether a hedging\nrelationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements. However, an entity\nshall use a method that captures the relevant characteristics of the hedging\nrelationship including the sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Depending on\nthose factors, the method can be a qualitative or a quantitative assessment.\nFor example, when the critical terms (such as the nominal amount, maturity\nand underlying) of the hedging instrument and the hedged item match or are\nclosely aligned, it might be possible for an entity to conclude on the basis of a\nqualitative assessment of those critical terms that the hedging instrument and\nthe hedged item have values that will generally move in the opposite direction\nbecause of the same risk and hence that an economic relationship exists\nbetween the hedged item and the hedging instrument (see paragraphs\nB6.4.4–B6.4.6).\nB6.4.12\nB6.4.13\nB6.4.14\nIFRS 9\nA518 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 156}

It depends on the circumstances whether hedge ineffectiveness\narising from that fact could have a magnitude that a qualitative assessment\nwould not adequately capture.\nConversely, if the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged\nitem are not closely aligned, there is an increased level of uncertainty about\nthe extent of offset. Consequently, the hedge effectiveness during the term of\nthe hedging relationship is more difficult to predict. In such a situation it\nmight only be possible for an entity to conclude on the basis of a quantitative\nassessment that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and\nthe hedging instrument (see paragraphs B6.4.4 –B6.4.6). In some situations a\nquantitative assessment might also be needed to assess whether the hedge\nratio used for designating the hedging relationship meets the hedge\neffectiveness requirements (see paragraphs B6.4.9 –B6.4.11). An entity can use\nthe same or different methods for those two different purposes.\nIf there are changes in circumstances that affect hedge effectiveness, an entity\nmay have to change the method for assessing whether a hedging relationship\nmeets the hedge effectiveness requirements in order to ensure that the\nrelevant characteristics of the hedging relationship, including the sources of\nhedge ineffectiveness, are still captured.\nAn entity’s risk management is the main source of information to perform the\nassessment of whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness\nrequirements. This means that the management information (or analysis)\nused for decision -making purposes can be used as a basis for assessing\nwhether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\nAn entity’s documentation of the hedging relationship includes how it will\nassess the hedge effectiveness requirements, including the method or methods\nused.

Accordingly, such a hedge is a fair value hedge. However, in\naccordance with paragraph 6.5.4, a hedge of the foreign currency risk of a\nfirm commitment could alternatively be accounted for as a cash flow hedge.\nMeasurement of hedge ineffectiveness\nWhen measuring hedge ineffectiveness, an entity shall consider the time\nvalue of money. Consequently, the entity determines the value of the hedged\nitem on a present value basis and therefore the change in the value of the\nhedged item also includes the effect of the time value of money.\nTo calculate the change in the value of the hedged item for the purpose of\nmeasuring hedge ineffectiveness, an entity may use a derivative that would\nhave terms that match the critical terms of the hedged item (this is commonly\nreferred to as a ‘hypothetical derivative’), and, for example for a hedge of\na forecast transaction, would be calibrated using the hedged price (or rate)\nlevel. For example, if the hedge was for a two-sided risk at the current market\nlevel, the hypothetical derivative would represent a hypothetical forward\ncontract that is calibrated to a value of nil at the time of designation of the\nhedging relationship. If the hedge was for example for a one-sided risk, the\nhypothetical derivative would represent the intrinsic value of a hypothetical\noption that at the time of designation of the hedging relationship is at the\nmoney if the hedged price level is the current market level, or out of the\nmoney if the hedged price level is above (or, for a hedge of a long position,\nbelow) the current market level. Using a hypothetical derivative is one\npossible way of calculating the change in the value of the hedged item. The\nhypothetical derivative replicates the hedged item and hence results in the\nsame outcome as if that change in value was determined by a different\napproach. Hence, using a ‘hypothetical derivative’ is not a method in its own\nright but a mathematical expedient that can only be used to calculate the\nvalue of the hedged item. Consequently, a ‘hypothetical derivative’ cannot be\nused to include features in the value of the hedged item that only exist in the\nhedging instrument (but not in the hedged item). An example is debt\ndenominated in a foreign currency (irrespective of whether it is fixed-rate or\nvariable-rate debt). When using a hypothetical derivative to calculate the\nchange in the value of such debt or the present value of the cumulative\nchange in its cash flows, the hypothetical derivative cannot simply impute a\ncharge for exchanging different currencies even though actual derivatives\nunder which different currencies are exchanged might include such a charge\n(for example, cross-currency interest rate", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 158}

Changes to designated quantities of a\nhedged item or of a hedging instrument for a different purpose do not\nconstitute rebalancing for the purpose of this Standard.\nRebalancing is accounted for as a continuation of the hedging relationship in\naccordance with paragraphs B6.5.9 –B6.5.21. On rebalancing, the hedge\nineffectiveness of the hedging relationship is determined and recognised\nimmediately before adjusting the hedging relationship.\nAdjusting the hedge ratio allows an entity to respond to changes in the\nrelationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item that arise\nfrom their underlyings or risk variables. For example, a hedging relationship\nin which the hedging instrument and the hedged item have different but\nrelated underlyings changes in response to a change in the relationship\nbetween those two underlyings (for example, different but related reference\nindices, rates or prices). Hence, rebalancing allows the continuation of a\nhedging relationship in situations in which the relationship between the\nhedging instrument and the hedged item changes in a way that can be\ncompensated for by adjusting the hedge ratio.\nFor example, an entity hedges an exposure to Foreign Currency A using a\ncurrency derivative that references Foreign Currency B and Foreign Currencies\nA and B are pegged (ie their exchange rate is maintained within a band or at\nan exchange rate set by a central bank or other authority). If the exchange\nrate between Foreign Currency A and Foreign Currency B were changed (ie a\nnew band or rate was set), rebalancing the hedging relationship to reflect the\nnew exchange rate would ensure that the hedging relationship would\ncontinue to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement for the hedge ratio in\nthe new circumstances. In contrast, if there was a default on the currency\nderivative, changing the hedge ratio could not ensure that the hedging\nrelationship would continue to meet that hedge effectiveness requirement.\nHence, rebalancing does not facilitate the continuation of a hedging\nrelationship in situations in which the relationship between the hedging\ninstrument and the hedged item changes in a way that cannot be\ncompensated for by adjusting the hedge ratio.\nNot every change in the extent of offset between the changes in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument and the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows\nconstitutes a change in the relationship between the hedging instrument and\nthe hedged item.

Hence, this\nevaluation requires judgement.\nFluctuation around a constant hedge ratio (and hence the related hedge\nineffectiveness) cannot be reduced by adjusting the hedge ratio in response to\neach particular outcome. Hence, in such circumstances, the change in the\nextent of offset is a matter of measuring and recognising hedge ineffectiveness\nbut does not require rebalancing.\nConversely, if changes in the extent of offset indicate that the fluctuation is\naround a hedge ratio that is different from the hedge ratio that is currently\nused for that hedging relationship, or that there is a trend leading away from\nthat hedge ratio, hedge ineffectiveness can be reduced by adjusting the hedge\nratio, whereas retaining the hedge ratio would increasingly produce hedge\nineffectiveness.

Instead, hedge accounting for that hedging\nrelationship shall be discontinued (despite that an entity might designate a\nnew hedging relationship that involves the hedging instrument or hedged\nitem of the previous hedging relationship as described in paragraph B6.5.28).\nIf a hedging relationship is rebalanced, the adjustment to the hedge ratio can\nbe effected in different ways:\n(a) the weighting of the hedged item can be increased (which at the same\ntime reduces the weighting of the hedging instrument) by:\n(i) increasing the volume of the hedged item; or\n(ii) decreasing the volume of the hedging instrument.\n(b) the weighting of the hedging instrument can be increased (which at\nthe same time reduces the weighting of the hedged item) by:\n(i) increasing the volume of the hedging instrument; or\n(ii) decreasing the volume of the hedged item.\nChanges in volume refer to the quantities that are part of the hedging\nrelationship. Hence, decreases in volumes do not necessarily mean that the\nitems or transactions no longer exist, or are no longer expected to occur, but\nthat they are not part of the hedging relationship. For example, decreasing the\nvolume of the hedging instrument can result in the entity retaining a\nderivative, but only part of it might remain a hedging instrument of the\nhedging relationship. This could occur if the rebalancing could be effected\nonly by reducing the volume of the hedging instrument in the hedging\nrelationship, but with the entity retaining the volume that is no longer\nneeded.

The 10\ntonnes of the hedged item that are no longer part of the hedging relationship\nwould be accounted for in accordance with the requirements for the\ndiscontinuation of hedge accounting (see paragraphs 6.5.6 –6.5.7 and\nB6.5.22–B6.5.28).\nB6.5.18\nB6.5.19\nB6.5.20\nIFRS 9\nA524 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 162}
{"text": "When rebalancing a hedging relationship, an entity shall update its analysis of\nthe sources of hedge ineffectiveness that are expected to affect the hedging\nrelationship during its (remaining) term (see paragraph B6.4.2). The\ndocumentation of the hedging relationship shall be updated accordingly.\nDiscontinuation of hedge accounting\nDiscontinuation of hedge accounting applies prospectively from the date on\nwhich the qualifying criteria are no longer met.\nAn entity shall not de-designate and thereby discontinue a hedging\nrelationship that:\n(a) still meets the risk management objective on the basis of which it\nqualified for hedge accounting (ie the entity still pursues that risk\nmanagement objective); and\n(b) continues to meet all other qualifying criteria (after taking into\naccount any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable).\nFor the purposes of this Standard, an entity’s risk management strategy is\ndistinguished from its risk management objectives. The risk management\nstrategy is established at the highest level at which an entity determines how\nit manages its risk. Risk management strategies typically identify the risks to\nwhich the entity is exposed and set out how the entity responds to them. A\nrisk management strategy is typically in place for a longer period and may\ninclude some flexibility to react to changes in circumstances that occur while\nthat strategy is in place (for example, different interest rate or commodity\nprice levels that result in a different extent of hedging). This is normally set\nout in a general document that is cascaded down through an entity through\npolicies containing more specific guidelines. In contrast, the risk management\nobjective for a hedging relationship applies at the level of a particular hedging\nrelationship. It relates to how the particular hedging instrument that has been\ndesignated is used to hedge the particular exposure that has been designated\nas the hedged item. Hence, a risk management strategy can involve many\ndifferent hedging relationships whose risk management objectives relate to\nexecuting that overall risk management strategy. For example:\n(a) an entity has a strategy of managing its interest rate exposure on debt\nfunding that sets ranges for the overall entity for the mix between\nvariable-rate and fixed-rate funding. The strategy is to maintain\nbetween 20 per cent and 40 per cent of the debt at fixed rates. The\nentity decides from time to time how to execute this strategy (ie where\nit positions itself within the 20 per cent to 40 per cent range for fixed-\nrate interest exposure) depending on the level of interest rates. If\ninterest rates are low the entity fixes the interest for more debt than\nwhen interest rates are high. The entity’s debt is CU100 of variable-rate\ndebt of which CU30 is swapped into a fixed-rate exposure. The entity\ntakes advantage of low interest rates to issue an additional CU50 of\ndebt to finance a major investment, which the entity does by issuing a\nfixed-rate bond. In the light of the low interest rates, the entity decides\nto set its fixed interest-rate exposure to 40 per cent of the total debt by\nB6.5.21\nB6.5.22\nB6.5.23\nB6.5.24\nIFRS 9\n© IFRS Foundation A525", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 163}
{"text": "reducing by CU20 the extent to which it previously hedged its variable-\nrate exposure, resulting in CU60 of fixed-rate exposure. In this\nsituation the risk management strategy itself remains unchanged.\nHowever, in contrast the entity’s execution of that strategy has\nchanged and this means that, for CU20 of variable-rate exposure that\nwas previously hedged, the risk management objective has changed (ie\nat the hedging relationship level). Consequently, in this situation\nhedge accounting must be discontinued for CU20 of the previously\nhedged variable-rate exposure. This could involve reducing the swap\nposition by a CU20 nominal amount but, depending on the\ncircumstances, an entity might retain that swap volume and, for\nexample, use it for hedging a different exposure or it might become\npart of a trading book. Conversely, if an entity instead swapped a part\nof its new fixed-rate debt into a variable-rate exposure, hedge\naccounting would have to be continued for its previously hedged\nvariable-rate exposure.\n(b) some exposures result from positions that frequently change, for\nexample, the interest rate risk of an open portfolio of debt\ninstruments. The addition of new debt instruments and\nthe derecognition of debt instruments continuously change that\nexposure (ie it is different from simply running off a position that\nmatures). This is a dynamic process in which both the exposure and\nthe hedging instruments used to manage it do not remain the same for\nlong. Consequently, an entity with such an exposure frequently adjusts\nthe hedging instruments used to manage the interest rate risk as the\nexposure changes. For example, debt instruments with 24 months’\nremaining maturity are designated as the hedged item for interest rate\nrisk for 24 months. The same procedure is applied to other time\nbuckets or maturity periods. After a short period of time, the entity\ndiscontinues all, some or a part of the previously designated hedging\nrelationships for maturity periods and designates new hedging\nrelationships for maturity periods on the basis of their size and the\nhedging instruments that exist at that time. The discontinuation of\nhedge accounting in this situation reflects that those hedging\nrelationships are established in such a way that the entity looks at a\nnew hedging instrument and a new hedged item instead of the\nhedging instrument and the hedged item that were designated\npreviously. The risk management strategy remains the same, but there\nis no risk management objective that continues for those previously\ndesignated hedging relationships, which as such no longer exist. In\nsuch a situation, the discontinuation of hedge accounting applies to\nthe extent to which the risk management objective has changed. This\ndepends on the situation of an entity and could, for example, affect all\nor only some hedging relationships of a maturity period, or only part\nof a hedging relationship.\nIFRS 9\nA526 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 164}

For accounting purposes, this works as a ‘natural’ hedge\nbecause the gains and losses from the foreign currency risk on all of\nthose items are immediately recognised in profit or loss. Consequently,\nfor accounting purposes, if the hedging relationship is designated for\nthe period up to the payment date, it must be discontinued when the\nreceivable is recognised, because the risk management objective of the\noriginal hedging relationship no longer applies. The foreign currency\nrisk is now managed within the same strategy but on a different basis.\nConversely, if an entity had a different risk management objective and\nmanaged the foreign currency risk as one continuous hedging\nrelationship specifically for that forecast sales amount and the\nresulting receivable until the settlement date, hedge accounting would\ncontinue until that date.\nThe discontinuation of hedge accounting can affect:\n(a) a hedging relationship in its entirety; or\n(b) a part of a hedging relationship (which means that hedge accounting\ncontinues for the remainder of the hedging relationship).\nA hedging relationship is discontinued in its entirety when, as a whole, it\nceases to meet the qualifying criteria.

However,\nif an entity has a history of having designated hedges of forecast\ntransactions and having subsequently determined that the forecast\ntransactions are no longer expected to occur, the entity’s ability to\npredict forecast transactions accurately is called into question when\npredicting similar forecast transactions. This affects the assessment of\nwhether similar forecast transactions are highly probable (see\nparagraph 6.3.3) and hence whether they are eligible as hedged items.\nAn entity can designate a new hedging relationship that involves the hedging\ninstrument or hedged item of a previous hedging relationship for which hedge\naccounting was (in part or in its entirety) discontinued. This does not\nconstitute a continuation of a hedging relationship but is a restart.

For example, the forecast transaction would be specified as:\n(a) the first FC60 of purchases of Machinery Type A that are expected to\naffect profit or loss from the third reporting period over the next\nten reporting periods;\n(b) the first FC40 of purchases of Machinery Type B that are expected to\naffect profit or loss from the fourth reporting period over the next\n20 reporting periods; and\n(c) the first FC50 of purchases of Raw Material A that are expected to be\nreceived in the third reporting period and sold, ie affect profit or loss,\nin that and the next reporting period.\nSpecifying the nature of the forecast transaction volumes would include\naspects such as the depreciation pattern for items of property, plant and\nequipment of the same kind, if the nature of those items is such that the\ndepreciation pattern could vary depending on how the entity uses those items.\nFor example, if the entity uses items of Machinery Type A in two different\nproduction processes that result in straight-line depreciation over ten\nreporting periods and the units of production method respectively, its\ndocumentation of the forecast purchase volume for Machinery Type A would\ndisaggregate that volume by which of those depreciation patterns will apply.\nFor a cash flow hedge of a net position, the amounts determined in\naccordance with paragraph 6.5.11 shall include the changes in the value of the\nitems in the net position that have a similar effect as the hedging instrument\nin conjunction with the fair value change on the hedging instrument.\nB6.6.8\nB6.6.9\nIFRS", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 173}

{"text": "However, the changes in the value of the items in the net position that have a\nsimilar effect as the hedging instrument are recognised only once the\ntransactions that they relate to are recognised, such as when a forecast sale is\nrecognised as revenue. For example, an entity has a group of highly probable\nforecast sales in nine months’ time for FC100 and a group of highly probable\nforecast purchases in 18 months’ time for FC120. It hedges the foreign\ncurrency risk of the net position of FC20 using a forward exchange contract\nfor FC20. When determining the amounts that are recognised in the cash flow\nhedge reserve in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11(a) –6.5.11(b), the entity\ncompares:\n(a) the fair value change on the forward exchange contract together with\nthe foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly\nprobable forecast sales; with\n(b) the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly\nprobable forecast purchases.\nHowever, the entity recognises only amounts related to the forward exchange\ncontract until the highly probable forecast sales transactions are recognised in\nthe financial statements, at which time the gains or losses on those forecast\ntransactions are recognised (ie the change in the value attributable to the\nchange in the foreign exchange rate between the designation of the hedging\nrelationship and the recognition of revenue).\nSimilarly, if in the example the entity had a nil net position it would compare\nthe foreign currency risk related changes in the value of the highly probable\nforecast sales with the foreign currency risk related changes in the value of\nthe highly probable forecast purchases. However, those amounts are\nrecognised only once the related forecast transactions are recognised in the\nfinancial statements.\nLayers of groups of items designated as the hedged item\nFor the same reasons noted in paragraph B6.3.19, designating layer\ncomponents of groups of existing items requires the specific identification of\nthe nominal amount of the group of items from which the hedged layer\ncomponent is defined.\nA hedging relationship can include layers from several different groups of\nitems. For example, in a hedge of a net position of a group of assets and a\ngroup of liabilities, the hedging relationship can comprise, in combination, a\nlayer component of the group of assets and a layer component of the group of\nliabilities.\nPresentation of hedging instrument gains or losses\nIf items are hedged together as a group in a cash flow hedge, they might affect\ndifferent line items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive\nincome. The presentation of hedging gains or losses in that statement depends\non the group of items.\nB6.6.10\nB6.6.11\nB6.6.12\nB6.6.13\nIFRS 9\nA536 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 174}
{"text": "If the group of items does not have any offsetting risk positions (for example,\na group of foreign currency expenses that affect different line items in the\nstatement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income that are hedged\nfor foreign currency risk) then the reclassified hedging instrument gains or\nlosses shall be apportioned to the line items affected by the hedged items. This\napportionment shall be done on a systematic and rational basis and shall not\nresult in the grossing up of the net gains or losses arising from a single\nhedging instrument.\nIf the group of items does have offsetting risk positions (for example, a group\nof sales and expenses denominated in a foreign currency hedged together for\nforeign currency risk) then an entity shall present the hedging gains or losses\nin a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss and other\ncomprehensive income. Consider, for example, a hedge of the foreign\ncurrency risk of a net position of foreign currency sales of FC100 and foreign\ncurrency expenses of FC80 using a forward exchange contract for FC20. The\ngain or loss on the forward exchange contract that is reclassified from the\ncash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss (when the net position affects profit\nor loss) shall be presented in a separate line item from the hedged sales and\nexpenses. Moreover, if the sales occur in an earlier period than the expenses,\nthe sales revenue is still measured at the spot exchange rate in accordance\nwith IAS 21. The related hedging gain or loss is presented in a separate line\nitem, so that profit or loss reflects the effect of hedging the net position, with\na corresponding adjustment to the cash flow hedge reserve. When the hedged\nexpenses affect profit or loss in a later period, the hedging gain or loss\npreviously recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve on the sales is\nreclassified to profit or loss and presented as a separate line item from those\nthat include the hedged expenses, which are measured at the spot exchange\nrate in accordance with IAS 21.\nFor some types of fair value hedges, the objective of the hedge is not primarily\nto offset the fair value change of the hedged item but instead to transform the\ncash flows of the hedged item. For example, an entity hedges the fair value\ninterest rate risk of a fixed-rate debt instrument using an interest rate swap.\nThe entity’s hedge objective is to transform the fixed-interest cash flows into\nfloating interest cash flows. This objective is reflected in the accounting for\nthe hedging relationship by accruing the net interest accrual on the interest\nrate swap in profit or loss. In the case of a hedge of a net position (for\nexample, a net position of a fixed-rate asset and a fixed-rate liability), this net\ninterest accrual must be presented in a separate line item in the statement of\nprofit or loss and other comprehensive income. This is to avoid the grossing\nup of a single instrument’s net gains or losses into offsetting gross amounts\nand recognising them in different line items (for example, this avoids grossing\nup a net interest receipt on a single interest rate swap into gross interest\nrevenue and gross interest expense).\nB6.6.14\nB6.6.15\nB6.6.16\nIFRS 9\n© I", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 175}

For that purpose, an entity shall determine whether financial\nassets meet the definition of held for trading as if the entity had purchased\nthe assets at the date of initial application.\nImpairment\nOn transition, an entity should seek to approximate the credit risk on initial\nrecognition by considering all reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable without undue cost or effort. An entity is not required to undertake\nan exhaustive search for information when determining, at the date of\ntransition, whether there have been significant increases in credit risk since\ninitial recognition. If an entity is unable to make this determination without\nundue cost or effort paragraph 7.2.20 applies.\nIn order to determine the loss allowance on financial instruments initially\nrecognised (or loan commitments or financial guarantee contracts to which\nthe entity became a party to the contract) prior to the date of initial\napplication, both on transition and until the derecognition of those items an\nentity shall consider information that is relevant in determining or\napproximating the credit risk at initial recognition. In order to determine or\napproximate the initial credit risk, an entity may consider internal and\nexternal information, including portfolio information, in accordance with\nparagraphs B5.5.1–B5.5.6.\nAn entity with little historical information may use information from internal\nreports and statistics (that may have been generated when deciding whether\nto launch a new product), information about similar products or peer group\nexperience for comparable financial instruments, if relevant.\nDefinitions (Appendix A)\nDerivatives\nTypical examples of derivatives are futures and forward, swap and option\ncontracts. A derivative usually has a notional amount, which is an amount of\ncurrency, a number of shares, a number of units of weight or volume or other\nunits specified in the contract. However, a derivative instrument does not\nrequire the holder or writer to invest or receive the notional amount at the\ninception of the contract. Alternatively, a derivative could require a fixed\npayment or payment of an amount that can change (but not proportionally\nwith a change in the underlying) as a result of some future event that is\nB7.2.1\nB7.2.2\nB7.2.3\nB7.2.4\nBA.1\nIFRS 9\nA538 © IFRS Foundation", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 176}
{"text": "unrelated to a notional amount. For example, a contract may require a fixed\npayment of CU1,000 if six -month LIBOR increases by 100 basis points. Such a\ncontract is a derivative even though a notional amount is not specified.\nThe definition of a derivative in this Standard includes contracts that are\nsettled gross by delivery of the underlying item (eg a forward contract to\npurchase a fixed rate debt instrument). An entity may have a contract to buy\nor sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial\ninstrument or by exchanging financial instruments (eg a contract to buy or\nsell a commodity at a fixed price at a future date). Such a contract is within\nthe scope of this Standard unless it was entered into and continues to be held\nfor the purpose of delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the\nentity’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. However, this\nStandard applies to such contracts for an entity’s expected purchase, sale or\nusage requirements if the entity makes a designation in accordance with\nparagraph 2.5 (see paragraphs 2.4–2.7).\nOne of the defining characteristics of a derivative is that it has an initial net\ninvestment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts\nthat would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market\nfactors. An option contract meets that definition because the premium is less\nthan the investment that would be required to obtain the underlying financial\ninstrument to which the option is linked. A currency swap that requires an\ninitial exchange of different currencies of equal fair values meets the\ndefinition because it has a zero initial net investment.\nA regular way purchase or sale gives rise to a fixed price commitment between\ntrade date and settlement date that meets the definition of a derivative.\nHowever, because of the short duration of the commitment it is not\nrecognised as a derivative financial instrument. Instead, this Standard\nprovides for special accounting for such regular way contracts (see paragraphs\n3.1.2 and B3.1.3–B3.1.6).\nThe definition of a derivative refers to non -financial variables that are not\nspecific to a party to the contract. These include an index of earthquake losses\nin a particular region and an index of temperatures in a particular city.\nNon-financial variables specific to a party to the contract include the\noccurrence or non -occurrence of a fire that damages or destroys an asset of a\nparty to the contract. A change in the fair value of a non -financial asset is\nspecific to the owner if the fair value reflects not only changes in market\nprices for such assets (a financial variable) but also the condition of the\nspecific non -financial asset held (a non -financial variable). For example, if a\nguarantee of the residual value of a specific car exposes the guarantor to the\nrisk of changes in the car’s physical condition, the change in that residual\nvalue is specific to the owner of the car.\nFinancial assets and liabilities held for trading\nTrading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling, and\nfinancial instruments held for trading generally are used with the objective of\ngenerating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin.\nBA.2\nBA.3\nBA.4\nBA.5\nBA.6\nIFRS 9", "source": "ifrs-9-financial-instruments.pdf", "page": 177}

Introduction \n3.1 Risks can be considered simply as “uncertainties that matter”. A risk is a \npossible future event that will either adversely or beneficially affect our ability \nto achieve our objectives. It considers both sides of the risk coin, ie., threats \nand opportunities:-\n A threat is a possible future event or action which will adversely \naffect the ICO’s ability to successfully achieve its goals, priorities \nand objectives. \n An opportunity is an event or action that will enhance our ability \nto achieve these. \nRisk is part of everything we do. Managing risk improves the way we \ndeliver our services. Some risks will always exist and will never be \neliminated, but through our risk identification we can anticipate and \nrespond to risks where we can. This means that we are better able \nto:-\n minimise the likelihood and impact of a threat occurring to within \nour risk appetite, or \n maximise the likelihood and impact of an opportunity happening \nto help us achieve our objectives. \n3.2. The ICO will manage risk (both threats and opportunity), effectively and \nin a consistent manner in all aspects of its business including planning, \ndelivering, operating and overseeing programmes and performance. All \nmanagement levels will develop and encourage a culture of well-\ninformed risk-based decision making. Managing risk will be at the core \nof the ICO’s governance, enabling sound strategic and operational \ndecision making and good business management.

Goal  #1:  Risk  Governance  &  Leadership6  \nRisk management will be embedded into the ethos, culture, policies and \npractices of the ICO so that risk management is an integral part of decision \nmaking, management and governance practices at all levels. \n4.1 Considering and responding to existing and new threats, and the ability \nto recognise and seize new opportunities, is fundamental to achieving \nthe ICO’s desired goals and key strategic priorities. Underlying this is a \ncommitment from the ICO to promote openness, transparency and \naccountability and good governance. Decisions made by the ICO are \nevidence-based and subject to appropriate challenge. This requires high \nstandards of corporate governance. Effective risk management is a key \nprinciple of corporate governance and a key contributor to a sound \ncontrol environment. \n4.2 Risk management plays a key role in helping us achieve our objectives \nand priorities.

Audit Scotland provides the Auditor General for Scotland and the Accounts \nCommission with the services they need to check that public money is spent \nproperly, efficiently and effectively. \n2.  The risks we identify in the organisations we audit (audit risk) is central to our \nrole and how we go about our audit work. However, we, like the bodies we \naudit, are also subject to risk (business risk) and we need to have robust \narrangements in place to manage those risks.  \n3.  This document sets out our approach to risk management and outlines the \nkey objectives, strategies, and responsibilities for the management of risk \nacross the organisation. It applies to all Audit Scotland colleagues and should \nbe applied consistently across the organisation. It is supported by training and \nguidance to ensure that our colleagues are 'risk aware' but not 'risk averse'. \nOverview of risk management  \n4.  We are committed to achieving the aims defined in Public Audit in Scotland, \nour Corporate Plan and Business Plans. In doing so, we realise that we will face \na variety of risks. \n5.  Risk is regarded as a quantifiable level of exposure to the threat of an event \nor action that could adversely affect our ability to achieve our objectives \nsuccessfully. The task of management is to respond to these risks effectively so \nas to maximise the likelihood of Audit Scotland achieving its objectives and \nensuring the best use of resources.  \n6.  We use risk management to systematically identify, record, monitor and \nreport risks to Audit Scotland to enable the organisation to meet its objectives \nand to plan actions to mitigate risks.  \n7.  There are five key aspects to our risk management process are illustrated in \nExhibit 1.", "source": "risk_management_framework_24-26.pdf", "page": 3}

We are committed to ensuring that the management of risk underpins all of \nour business activities and that robust risk management procedures are in place \nthroughout the organisation. The application of this policy and strategy will \nenable us to identify, assess and respond to a changing risk profile.   \n9.  We have a responsibility to manage risks and support a systematic approach \nto risk management including the promotion of a risk aware culture.  \n10.  The application of risk management practices cannot, and will not, \ncompletely eliminate all risk exposure. Through the application of the risk \nmanagement approach identified in this framework, we aim to achieve a better \nunderstanding of the risks faced by - and the implications for the business - and \nso inform our decision-making. \n11.  We recognise that risk, as well as posing a threat, also represents \nopportunities for developing innovative ways of working. There are also risks \nassociated with not looking for, or taking, opportunities when they arise. \nInnovation and best practice should be shared across Audit Scotland, and we \nwant to be 'risk aware', but not 'risk averse'. \n12.  The importance of risk management, and the part it plays in managing the \norganisation, is set out in the Corporate Plan and other supporting \ndocumentation such as Business Plans and risk registers. It is also summarised \nin the Annual Report and Accounts each year. \n13.  We expect management to take action to manage and mitigate the effects \nof those risks that are considered to be in excess of Audit Scotland's risk \nappetite.  \n14.  Where a risk is deemed to be significant and/or in excess of Audit \nScotland's risk appetite it will be highlighted in the Audit Scotland risk register \nalong with the controls and actions being taken to mitigate the risk. \n15.  The active, ongoing commitment and full support of the Audit Scotland \nBoard through the work of the Audit Committee and Audit Scotland Executive \nTeam (ET) is a necessary and essential part of this framework. Management \nwill ensure that effective mechanisms are in place for assessing, monitoring and \nresponding to any risks arising. \n16.  The corporate Performance, Financial and Risk Management Group \n(PFRMG)  acts as a 'Risk Forum'. Its role includes reviewing, challenging and \nagreeing which risks should be escalated for inclusion in the Audit Scotland risk \nregister.   \n17.  This forum is complemented by regular meetings of risk lead officers in \neach of the business groups, who typically meet on a two monthly basis.", "source": "risk_management_framework_24-26.pdf", "page": 5}

{"text": "3. Risk management approach | 7 \n \n3. Risk management approach \n \nRisk management objectives \n19.  The following objectives form the basis of our Risk Management \nFramework. We aim to: \n• Promote awareness of business risk and embed the approach to its \nmanagement throughout the organisation. \n• Seek to identify, assess, control and report on any business risk that will \nundermine the delivery of Audit Scotland's business priorities, at a \nstrategic and operational level. \nRisk management vision \n20.  In order to achieve our vision to ensure public money is well spent to meet \nthe needs of Scotland’s people we must have strong governance and \nmanagement arrangements in place. Effective risk management is a core \ncomponent of these arrangements.   \n21.  We will identify the risk and its root cause at the earliest opportunity; assess \nthe potential impact on the organisation and put in place controls to mitigate the \nrisk. \n22.  Additionally, we will seek to obtain assurance that the controls relied on to \nmitigate the key risks are effective. An assurance framework has been \ndeveloped to support the ongoing monitoring of controls (see monitoring and \nreporting below). \nRisk management culture \n23.  We recognise the values of an effective risk management culture. Systems \nand processes are dependent on the people operating and supporting them. \nThey are also dependent on reflecting the environment within which they \noperate. Our approach to risk management therefore focuses on all of these \naspects.  \n24.  We will: \n• review the corporate plan on an annual basis \n• review the Audit Scotland risk register and carry out risk deep dives on \nselected risks on a regular basis \n• integrate risk management with planning at strategic and operational \nlevels", "source": "risk_management_framework_24-26.pdf", "page": 7}

To ensure that we have a full understanding of the risks we face and their \nimplications risks will be identified and assessed at three levels: \n• Corporate: Those risks that, if realised, could have a significant \ndetrimental effect on Audit Scotland's strategic priorities, key business \nprocesses and activities.  \n• Business group and thematic: Those business risks that, if realised, \ncould have a significant detrimental effect on a Business Group's key \nobjectives and activities. This also includes thematic risks, for example \ninformation risks monitored by the Information Governance and \nManagement  Group (IGMG) and the ISQM risk register managed by \nI&Q. \n• Project/ audit: Those business risks that, if realised, could have a \nsignificant detrimental effect on the outcome of a project/ audit.  \n26.  We will also use other elements of our management arrangements to inform \nour risk assessments (Exhibit 2).

The Accountable Officer has overall responsibility for risk management for \nAudit Scotland.  \n32.  Executive Team has day to day responsibility for the systems of internal \ncontrol, including risk management. All staff should be risk aware. The key roles \nand responsibilities in relation to risk are summarised in Appendix 1.  \n33.  The Audit Scotland Risk Register (ASRR) is structured around our strategic \nobjectives, follows a standard format (Appendix 2) and includes the following \nelements: \n• risk description \n• gross risk assessments of likelihood and impact  \n• active and monitoring controls in place to mitigate the gross risks \n• net risk assessments of likelihood and impact and any changes \n• further actions or monitoring required to reduce risk including; how the \nplanned actions will manage the risk, timescales, action owners and risk \nreview dates \n• target risk and target mitigation date \n• risk owner. \n34.  Risks for action are considered by Executive Team and the Audit Committee \nfive times a year as a minimum. Risks for monitoring, typically strategic risks - \nbut where the risk assessment is 'green' are reported at summary level to \nExecutive Team and the Audit Committee and are monitored at a more detailed \nlevel by the PFRMG. \n35.  Risk leads in each business group meet on a regular basis, typically every \ntwo months, to discuss the risk profile at the corporate and business group \nlevel. This informs the content of the risk registers at both a strategic and \noperational level. \n36.

{"text": "5. Risk management process | 13 \n \n5. Risk management process \n \nRisk identification \n40.  Risk identification is an ongoing activity, with individual risks and the impact \nand/or likelihood of risks materialising changing regularly. Risk identification is \nthe process of determining what risks might prevent us from delivering our \nobjectives, whether these are strategic or operational.  \n41.  Risks can be triggered/identified from a number of sources including: \n• changes to the operating environment/periodic horizon scanning \n• planning (at strategic, business group and operational levels) \n• Audit Committee/ Executive Team risk workshops (minimum one per \nyear) \n• Executive Team/ Leadership Group strategic sessions \n• monitoring of audit risks (using the audit risk management framework) \n• monitoring of performance \n• existing forums (board, audit committee, executive team, business \ngroup management teams, audit team/project group meetings) \n• risks identified by internal/external audit. \n42.  It is important, therefore, that risk features as a standing agenda item on \nExecutive Team meetings and working groups/ corporate forums across Audit \nScotland where appropriate. Any risks identified should be reported for inclusion \nin the relevant risk register which would, in turn, be reviewed by a risk owner. \n43.  Additional risk prompts/tools are included as appendix 3 to assist with this. \nRisk analysis and assessment \n44.  Once a risk is identified the risk is assessed. Risks are assessed \nconsidering – likelihood of the risk occurring, and if that risk was to occur, what \nthe impact (i.e. consequences) on the organisation would be. \n45.  Likelihood is categorised on a scale of 1 to 5 with one being rare and five \nalmost certain.  Impact will also be assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 with one being \ninsignificant and 5 being severe. Likelihood and impact are multiplied together \nto obtain a total a gross risk score as illustrated in Exhibit 4.", "source": "risk_management_framework_24-26.pdf", "page": 13}

Risk appetite is an expression of how much risk Audit Scotland is prepared \nto take. Those involved in risk evaluation and prioritisation should, when \nconsidering risk, discuss and express the risk appetite as they see it.  \n48.  The risk register format steers risk owners into considering risk appetite \nwhen updating a risk entry. They need to consider the risk score before and \nafter existing mitigating action but also the final tolerable risk status (i.e. what \nthey are aiming for in terms of status for that particular risk). \n49.

Based on risk scores there are four response options:  \n• Terminate - in this situation the risk is terminated by deciding not to \nproceed with an activity. For example, if a particular project is very high \nrisk and the risk cannot be mitigated it might be decided to cancel the \nproject. Alternatively, the decision may be made to carry out the activity \nin a different way. \n• Transfer - in this scenario, another party bears or shares all or part of \nthe risk. For example, this could include transferring out an area of work \nor by using insurance. \n• Treat - this involves identifying mitigating actions or controls to reduce \nrisk. These controls should be monitored on a regular basis to ensure \nthat they are effective. \n• Tolerate - in this case, it may not always be necessary (or appropriate) \nto take action to treat risks, for example, where the cost of treating the \nrisk is considered to outweigh the potential benefits. If the risk is shown \nas 'green' after mitigating actions, then it can probably be tolerated.", "source": "risk_management_framework_24-26.pdf", "page": 15}
{"text": "5. Risk management process | 16 \n \nRisk mitigation \n51.  These are the controls and actions put in place to reduce the likelihood of \nthe risk occurring or minimise the impact of the risk if it does occur. An internal \ncontrol system incorporating policies, processes, business continuity \narrangements and other aspects of Audit Scotland's operations should, when \ntaken together:  \n• enable the organisation to respond appropriately to business risks \n• help ensure the quality of internal and external reporting. This requires \nthe maintenance of proper records and processes that generate the \nflow of timely, relevant and reliable information, and \n• help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and also \nwith internal policies. This would include, for example, having formal \nwritten procedures and policies applied consistently across the \norganisation supported by training for staff.  \n52.  The residual risk which remains after taking account of the relevant \nmitigations is the net risk. It is also good practice to define 'target' risk which, in \nsimple terms, is the tolerable level of risk that the organisation should aim for. \n53.  The risk register format requires active and monitoring controls to be \nidentified to inform the net risk assessment. The risk register also prompts for \nadditional actions where the net risk is above the target risk. \nRisk escalation \n54.  This is a process which ensures that significant risks are escalated to the \nappropriate person or group. This is necessary to ensure the appropriate \ndecisions and/or actions are implemented to mitigate the risk. \n55.  It is vital to the risk escalation process that risk information is made \navailable to the right people in a timely way. There is no restriction on what may \nbe escalated for action, however the key criteria is that some form of \nintervention is required from more senior management.   \n56.  It is the responsibility of individual risk owners to raise risks which they \nbelieve require action by a higher authority. It should be emphasised though \nthat we want to discourage people from escalating risks that they should be \ndealing with themselves. High risk issues should be escalated through the \nhierarchy that makes up the risk universe so that they are captured in the \nappropriate register for information purposes. However, responsibility for \naddressing the risk may still remain with the originator. \n57.  Risks should feature as a standard agenda item at management and \nworking group meetings.

{"text": "6. Monitoring and reporting arrangements | 18 \n \n6. Monitoring and reporting \narrangements \n \nMonitoring risks \n59.  Risk management is an ongoing process that needs to be embedded in \neveryday activity. The process must be reviewed on a regular basis to remain \neffective. It is the responsibility, therefore, of each risk owner to review risks on \na regular basis and identify whether any revisions are required. The revision \nmay involve a re-assessment of impact and likelihood or planned mitigating \nactions. \n60.  It is important that risk is included as a standing item on the agenda for \nmanagement teams (at all levels within the organisation) and corporate \nforums/working groups where appropriate so that risks can be identified and \ncaptured. As a minimum, on a quarterly basis each Executive Director will seek \nassurance from individual risk owners that the risks in their assigned areas are \nbeing adequately monitored and action is being completed as agreed in formal \naction plans. \n61.  The Director of Corporate Support, and the PFRMG review risk on a \nquarterly basis. This includes a review of the high risks facing Audit Scotland \nand mitigating action plans. The Director of Corporate Support links directly with \nthe Executive Team and will advise them on which risks to escalate/ de-escalate \nfor inclusion or deletion from the Audit Scotland risk register. \n62.  The PFRMG also reviews the 'risk for monitoring'. These are strategic risks \nwhich are important, but which are within risk tolerances ('green risks') and \nescalates these to Executive Team where required. \n63.

In situations where a risk is classified as 'to be treated', and scores either \n'amber' or 'red' then action must be taken. This includes consideration of: \n• the risk owner reviewing the actions to be taken \n• the controls that need to be put in place / strengthened \n• the action owner, and \n• the timescale for implementation.", "source": "risk_management_framework_24-26.pdf", "page": 18}

Audit Scotland's risk management framework is supported through agreed \nreporting and assurance arrangements. This is to ensure that the key risks and \ntheir owners are clearly identified that mitigation and specified actions are \nappropriate and that actions are being carried out.  \n67.  The arrangements, include: \nCorporate level \n68.  The Audit Scotland's Board reviews and approves risk management policies \nand strategies.

The Audit Committee reviews the Audit Scotland Risk Register at each \nmeeting and receives an annual statement on risk management from the \ninternal auditors.

These ‘deep dives’ can take a variety \nof forms, depending on the nature of the risk and how best this can be \nexamined. This may include the consideration of risk deep dives, detailed \nsubject specific reports, presentations and workshops. The Audit Committee \napproves the schedule of risk deep dives each year, though this can be varied \nto accommodate new or emerging risks where this is required. \n72.  The Executive Team maintains, reviews and updates the Audit Scotland \nRisk Register on the key risks facing the organisation on a regular basis.

This model provides senior management with a snapshot \nof where the risk processes and principles Audit Scotland employs have led to \nchanges and progression in risk management.  It provides assurance that risk \nmanagement processes are fit for purpose and also identifies areas where \nfurther improvement is required. Audit Scotland's risk maturity model is attached \nas Appendix 5.  \n79.  The risk maturity model will be reviewed periodically by internal audit with \nfindings discussed by the Executive Team (via the PFRMG). The Executive \nTeam then propose any actions to raise 'maturity' in areas of poorer \nperformance for consideration by the Audit Committee and subsequent approval \nby the Audit Scotland Board where appropriate.", "source": "risk_management_framework_24-26.pdf", "page": 20}

{"text": "Guide to Using the Risk Management Q&A; Assistant\n■ Welcome I am your Risk Management Q&A; Assistant. I exist to help you explore, understand, and\nconnect financial risk regulations and best practices to your own documents. I always ground my\nanswers in the documents I have access to.\n■ What I Can Do\nI can: - Explain regulatory concepts like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). - Summarize best\npractices from Basel III, IFRS 9, or other standards. - Compare different sections or documents. -\nExtract numbers, formulas, and definitions directly from your documents. - Connect regulations to your\nuploaded data-based documents, like stress tests or policies. - Provide concise, clear answers with\ncitations so you can check the sources.\n■ What I Cannot Do\nI cannot: - Provide personal financial or investment advice. - Predict markets or future events. - Talk\nabout unrelated topics like weather, sports, or jokes. - Replace expert judgement or compliance\nfunctions. If asked, I will politely decline or redirect you back to financial risk.\n■■ How I Work\nI use a process called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). That means: 1. I search for relevant\npassages from my document library. 2. I generate an answer only using those passages. 3. I always\nshow citations so you can see exactly where the information came from. If I cannot find strong context, I\nwill tell you I don't know rather than guess.\n■ Uploading and Managing Documents\nYou can upload documents such as: - Basel III or other regulatory frameworks. - IFRS standards. -\nInternal policies, stress test reports, or risk manuals. - Training materials. After upload, the system will\nindex the new documents, and I will include them in my knowledge base.\n■ Asking Great Questions\nTips for better answers: - Be specific: 'What are the Basel III liquidity requirements?' is better than 'Tell\nme about risk.' - Use document keywords like LCR, NSFR, credit risk, capital buffer. - Break large\nquestions into smaller ones for more precise answers. - Ask for summaries, comparisons, or definitions.\n■ Meta-Questions", "source": "risk_qa_guide.pdf", "page": 1}
{"text": "You might ask things like: - 'Who are you?' - 'What can you do?' - 'What is your purpose?' - 'Why do you\nsometimes say no?' I will answer based on this guide: - I am a Risk Management Q&A; Assistant. - I\ncan explain regulatory standards and connect them to your documents. - My purpose is to help you\nunderstand and apply risk management principles. - I refuse when the retrieved context is weak, to\navoid hallucination.\n■ Fun Facts\nIf you ask me 'Tell me something fun', I will share interesting facts from the documents: - Basel III\nrequires banks to hold enough high-quality liquid assets to survive 30 days of stress outflows. - IFRS 9\nintroduced expected credit loss provisioning, changing how banks manage risk. - Some Basel\nguidelines on stress testing came directly from lessons learned in the 2008 financial crisis. - Regulatory\nframeworks often evolve, so staying updated is part of resilience.\n■ Edge Cases & Odd Questions\nWhat if you ask for a joke? I will explain I only focus on financial risk. What if you ask for personal\nfinancial advice? I will decline. What if you ask about weather or sports? I will redirect you to financial\nrisk topics. What if you ask me to predict markets? I will say I cannot predict the future. My role is\nlimited and safe: I stick to the documents I have.\n■ Trust and Transparency\nI always: - Ground my answers in the documents. - Provide citations so you can verify. - Refuse when\nconfidence is low. This ensures reliability and transparency in all responses.\n■ Final Reminder\nI am here to help you: - Understand financial risk regulations and best practices. - Connect those\nprinciples to your uploaded materials. - Deliver concise, trustworthy, cited answers. Stay focused on\nfinancial risk — that is where I provide the most value.", "source": "risk_qa_guide.pdf", "page": 2}
